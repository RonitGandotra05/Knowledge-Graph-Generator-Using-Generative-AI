# Knowledge Graph Generator Using Generative AI

An advanced tool that transforms research papers into interactive knowledge graphs using AI and Natural Language Processing. This project demonstrates automated extraction of entities, relationships, and insights from scientific literature, converting complex research into structured, visual knowledge networks.

## AI & NLP Technologies

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Extract complex relationships and insights from research papers
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies key entities, concepts, and technical terms from scientific text
- **Relation Extraction**: Automatically discovers and maps relationships between identified entities
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Transforms unstructured text into structured, interconnected knowledge networks
- **Text Mining**: Advanced processing of research papers to extract relevant information
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding context and meaning in scientific literature
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Converts research findings into structured JSON format for visualization

## Technical Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Process research papers in various formats (PDF, Text)
2. **Text Analysis**: Apply NLP techniques to understand document structure and content
3. **Entity Recognition**: Identify key concepts, terms, and relationships
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Establish connections between entities using AI
5. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Generate structured graph data
6. **Interactive Visualization**: Present data in an explorable network format

## Example Implementation

This repository contains an implementation focusing on biomedical research papers, demonstrating:

1. Azoospermia
2. Oligospermia
3. Asthenozoospermia
4. Teratospermia
5. Hypospermia
