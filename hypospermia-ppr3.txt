Hyposperrnia and Its Relationship to
Varicocele and Intrascrotal Tern perature

THAT HYPOSPERMIA may result from exposure of the testicles to slight
increases in temperature has been suggested for many years. During the
past 15 years, the relationship of varicocele to infertility has been studied
extensively in England and to a lesser extent in the United States.1, 9 Elevation of the testicular temperature by the varicocele has been proposed as
the etiology of this phenomenon.2, 3, 8, 10
In this report an effort is made to clarify the relationship of varicocele,
testicular temperature, and hypospermia.
HISTORY
In 1550, Ambrose Pare defined a varicocele as a compact group of vessels
filled with "melancholic" blood.11 For nearly 400 years, little additional
information was published on varicocele. In 1918, Ivanissivich described
the venous drainage of the testicle and scrotum. 4
Pain was the primary consideration in the treatment of varicocele until
1952, when Tullock proposed a relationship between varicocele and infertility and reported restoration of fertility following varicocele ligation. 10, 11
He reported the cases of 82 patients with counts below 20 million per cubic
centimeter. Within 6 months, 83.7% were judged fertile, and in 48 of 57
patients with less than 10% motility before treatment, this rating was increased to over 50% after ligation. Subsequent reports!' 5, 7, 8, 12 substantiated
the increased incidence of subfertility associated with varicocele. It was
also observed that a varicocele that persists in men older than 30 years is
more likely to be associated with subfertility.6

Young proposed two possible mechanisms by which varicocele may induce hypospermia: (1) venous congestion giving rise to anoxia with lack
of nutrition of the delicate germinal epithelium; (2) elevation of testicular
temperature.
In 1956 Hanley reported that normal temperature of the scrotal septum
is approximately 2.50 C. lower than that of the rectum.2,3 A large varicocele, he believed, reduced this differential to approximately 10 C. The
removal of a moderate-sized varicocele generally lowered the intrascrotal
temperature by about 10 C. He also reported 5 cases in which varicocele
ligation produced no demonstrable change in scrotal temperature although
the patients experienced marked improvement in fertility; these experiences suggested that a factor other than temperature is involved in hypospermia.
Hanley's work was essentially undisputed until 1966, when Tessler and
Krahn attempted to duplicate his data. 9 They inserted a needle thermocouple directly into each testicle and into the thigh percutaneously. In
their series the differential between intratesticular and thigh temperatures
was only slightly greater than 10 C. in both normal patients and those with
varicoceles. Also, variations in testicular temperature in the supine and
erect positions were less than 10 C.
CLINICAL OBSERVATION
From January 1965 to January 1967, 40 men were surgically treated for
varicocele. The operation in all cases was high ligation of the left spermatic
vein through a transverse muscle-splitting incision at the level of the
anterior superior iliac spine. The chief complaint in 35 cases was pain;
the remaining 5 patients had been referred for infertility evaluation. Sperm
counts were obtained from all patients as part of the preoperative evaluation. The number of patients with sperm counts below 20 million is striking
(Tables 1 and 2). Seventy per cent of these patients were subfertile, and
only 4 patients (10%) had sperm counts greater than 50 million per cubic
centimeter (Fig. 1).
An attempt to obtain a 3-month postoperation sperm count was successful in 9 patients (Table 2). The counts in 6 patients were within fertile
levels (a sperm count of 20 million or greater, and a motility of 60% or
greater). Two patients' sperm counts improved, but not to fertile levels.
One patient's sperm count did not improve. Another patient had no followup spenn count; however, his wife became pregnant twice in less than 2
years.

METHOD
In view of the conflicting reports concerning the existence of a significant
reduction by the varicocele, of the differential between intrascrotal and
body temperature, a study was undertaken in an attempt to reproduce Hanley's data. A thermistor needle telethermometer probe was inserted into the scrotal septum for the full length of the needle, and a rectal tele- thermometer was used to record body temperature. The scrotal septal and
rectal temperatures of patients having elective circumcisions were meas- ured as controls. Varicocele patients were tilted feet downward to approxi- mately 30°, or until their varicoceles were obviously distended. Initially,
all measurements were made under spinal anesthesia, and the patients were

"prepped" for 10 min. with PhisoHex* and water at room temperature.
With this regimen, a wide range of temperature differentials was noted in
both groups. This method may have resulted in cooling the scrotal contents.
Thereafter, PhisoHex and water were used at 37° C., and the temperature
differential became stabilized. However, this method conceivably could
increase the temperature of the scrotal contents. To reduce the effects of
these variables to the minimum, all subsequent temperatures were recorded

with no surgical preparation and no anesthesia other than for a tiny skin
wheal where the probe entered the scrotum.
RESULTS
Measurement of intrascrotal and rectal temperatures without surgical
preparation or anesthesia in 3 patients with varicoceles revealed the average intrascrotal temperature to be 0.90 C. less than that of the rectum
(Table 3). For 13 control patients without varicoceles, the average intrascrotal temperature was 0.60 C. less than body temperature (Table 3,
Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
Previous experiments have yielded conflicting results concerning the
effect of varicocele on testicular temperature. In the present study of 14
controls and 5 patients with varicoceles, the rectal and scrotal septal temperatures were carefully measured with the elimination of essentially all
variables except for presence or absence of a varicocele. The average intrascrotal temperature was only 0.60 C. less than that of the rectum. In
patients with varicoceles, the average intrascrotal temperature was 0.90 C.
less than that of the rectum.
Data in this study confirm a definite association of hypospermia with
varicocele. However, temperature measurements obtained on controls, as
well as on patients with varicoceles, fail to substantiate the statement that
varicoceles elevate scrotal temperatures above normal. Thus, the role of the
relatively elevated scrotal temperatures associated with varicoceles as the
cause of hypospermia cannot be confirmed by this study.
SUMMARY
There is a frequently observed, definite relationship between varicocele
and hypospermia. The average normal intrascrotal temperature is 0.60 C.
less than rectal temperature. In the presence of a varicocele, the intrascrotal temperature is 0.90 C. less than that of the rectum. \Ve have been unable to demonstrate that normal testicular temperature is significantly Jess
than in the presence of a varicocele. How a varicocele is able to suppress
spermatogenesis remains unsolved and is a challenging problem for further
investigation.
