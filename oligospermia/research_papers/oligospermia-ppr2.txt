Abstract: Infertility affects 12–15% of couples worldwide, and male factors are the cause of nearly
half of all cases. Studying seminal fluid composition could lead to additional diagnostic accuracy and
a better understanding of the pathophysiology of male factor infertility. Metabolomics offers a new
opportunity to evaluate biomarkers and better understand pathological mechanisms. The aim of
the study was to identify new markers or therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in male factor or
idiopathic infertility patients. Semen samples were obtained from 29 men with a normal spermogram
test, and from 18 oligozoospermic men. Samples were processed and analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance spectroscopy and, subsequently, multivariate and univariate statistical analyses. Receiving
Operator Curves (ROC) and Spearman correlations were also performed. An Orthogonal Partial
Least Square Discriminant Analysis supervised multivariate model was devised to compare the
groups. The levels of fructose, myo-inositol, aspartate and choline were altered. Moreover, Spearman
Correlation associated fructose, aspartate and myo-inositol with the total amount of spermatozoa,
total motile spermatozoa, % of immotility and % of “in situ” spermatozoic motility respectively.
NMR-based metabolomics allowed the identification of a specific metabolic fingerprint of the seminal
fluids of patients affected by oligozoospermia.

1. Introduction
Infertility affects 12–15% of couples worldwide, with profound psychological, social and economic
consequences. A male factor is the cause of nearly half of all infertility cases [1]. Non-pregnancy due
to male causes is diagnosed by seminal fluid analysis, which allows us to obtain information about
the functional state of the seminiferous tubules, epididymis and accessory sex glands. The World
Health Organization (WHO) has determined the criteria for normal seminal fluid characteristics [2] and
classifies the forms of male infertility by evaluating various parameters such as sperm count, motility
and morphology. Considering the cut-off values of these parameters, the WHO identifies descriptive
frameworks of various pathological states: oligozoospermia, astenozoospermia, theratozoospermia
and combinations of the three [3,4]. Numerous studies show a correlation between reduced sperm

count and non-pregnancy, showing evidence of the predictive value of sperm count [5,6]. There is some
debate as to whether semen analysis alone can adequately assess male fertility. The standardization of
procedures is essential, due to differences in results bringing the usefulness and accuracy of the test
into question [7,8]. Furthermore, in 10–20% of infertility cases no cause is identified, and a portion of
those cases is likely due to male factors as well [9,10].
Seminal fluid contains a variety of molecules produced primarily by the accessory sex glands, but
also by spermatozoa, and their precursors. This complex media supports not only sperm survival
and health but also optimal conditions for fertilization within the female reproductive tract [11]. Thus,
the study of seminal fluid composition for markers associated with infertility could lead to additional
diagnostic accuracy and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of male factor infertility. The
necessity to improve current knowledge on the molecular and cellular basis of the functionality of
sperm is evident. Improving the ability to diagnose, and facilitating the study of abnormal and/or
dysfunctional cells, is important for developing a possible therapy. Currently, despite numerous and
in-depth studies of male infertility, there is currently no effective therapy, bar the use of medically
assisted reproduction, debated by several authors [10].
One approach to identifying novel biomarkers of disease uses metabolomics in a combination of
analytical and biochemical techniques [12]. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass
spectrometry (MS) are the most frequently employed techniques in metabolomics and are powerful
methods for differentiating the diversities between cases and controls [13,14]. Bioinformatics increases
the value of metabolomic analysis by assessing general biochemical and signaling pathways that may
be altered in disease states [15]. To date, few metabolomics studies for human male factor infertility
have been reported [16–19]. Therefore, we performed an NMR metabolomic analysis of human seminal
plasma from normal fertile controls and men with oligospermic infertility. Our goal was to identify
new markers or therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in male factor or idiopathic infertility patients.
We hypothesized that specific metabolic pathways may be abnormal in oligospermic seminal fluid.
2. Methods
2.1. Sample Selection
This prospective study was conducted in the Department of Prenatal and Preimplantation Genetic
Diagnosis and Foetal Therapy, Ospedale Pediatrico Microcitemico A.Cao, (Cagliari, Italy). Written
consent was obtained from all participating men and the study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Microcitemico Hospital. Moreover, the study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Human ejaculates were obtained through masturbation after 3–4 days of
sexual abstinence. A portion of the sample was used for routine semen analysis (ejaculate volume,
sperm concentration, morphology assessment, motility and total progressive motile sperm count).
The morphology was assessed using the Papanicolau stain. The motility assessment was made using
the Makler chamber, first counting the motile elements by row and column and then the immotile
elements. The respective motility percentages and the total count were then carried out. To perform
a more accurate evaluation, the motility of the spermatozoa was subsequently evaluated, placing
20 µL of the sample on a slide and evaluating 200 spermatozoa at 200× [20,21]. All parameters refer to
the World Health Organization (WHO) manual 2010, V edition [22]. Semen samples were obtained
from 29 men with a proven normal spermogram test (control group, C) as assessed by WHO Manual
for Semen Analysis (2010): (Total spermatozoa (106
) ≥ 39, sperm concentration (106 mL−1
) ≥ 15,
sperm morphology (normal forms, %) ≥ 4, total motility (%) ≥ 40) and from 18 oligozoospermic
men. All the subjects were referred to our centre for infertility treatment. The main criterion for
classification of oligozoospermic men was low sperm quantity (<15 million spermatozoa/mL, <40%
motile spermatozoa, <4% normal forms). Ejaculate specimens were deposited directly in sterile
microurine jars. The clinical parameters of the enrolled patients are reported in Table 1.

2.2. Sample Preparation
500 µL of all the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12.052× g at 4 ◦C. The supernatant was
collected for metabolomic analysis. 400 µL of seminal fluid was mixed with 600 µL of methanol, 400 µL
of Milli-Q water and 600 µL of chloroform [23], then vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 4500 rpm,
15 min 4 ◦C. 750 µL of the supernatant was used for the NMR analysis. Aliquots (10 µL) from each
sample were used to create a pool for quality control (QC) samples. The QC sample was analyzed at
the beginning and at the end of the analysis.
2.3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis and Data Processing
For the NMR analysis, 600 µL of the water-phase, containing low-weight molecules (amino acids,
sugars, etc.) for each sample, were dried overnight in a speed-vacuum. The dried water-phase was
re-suspended in 697 µL of phosphate buffer 100 mM in D2O, pH 7.3 and 3 µL of trimethylsilyl-propanoic
acid (TSP) 5.07 mM.TSP was added to provide an internal reference for the chemical shifts (0 ppm),
and 650 µLof the solution were transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube.
The samples were analyzed with a Varian UNITY INOVA 500 spectrometer (Agilent Technologies,
Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), which was operated at 499 MHz, equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance
probe with z-axis pulsed field gradients, and with an auto-sampler with 50 locations. One-dimensional
1H-NMR spectra were collected at 300 K with a pre-sat pulse sequence. The spectra were recorded
with a spectral width of 6000 Hz, a frequency of 2 Hz; an acquisition time of 1.5 s, a relaxation delay of
2 ms, and a 90◦ pulse of 9.5 µs. The number of scans was 256. Each Free Induction Decay (FID) was
zero-filled to 64 k points and multiplied by a 0.5 Hz exponential line broadening function. The spectra
were manually phased and baseline corrected. By using MestReNova software (version 8.1, Mestrelab
Research S.L. Santiago de Compostela, Spain) each NMR spectrum was divided into consecutive “bins”
of 0.04 ppm. The spectral area investigated was the region between 0.8 and 8.6 ppm. To minimize the
effects of the different concentrations of seminal plasma samples, the integrated area within each bin
was normalized to a constant sum of 100. The final data set consisted of a 161 × 47 matrix.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
Multivariate statistical analysis was performed on NMR data by using SIMCA-P software (ver.
15.0, Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Umea, Sweden) [24]. The variables were Pareto scaled.
The initial data analyses were conducted using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
the exploration of the sample distributions without classification. In particular, PCA analysis was
Metabolites 2020, 10, 64 4 of 13
performed to observe intrinsic clusters and find outliers. To identify potential strong outliers,
the Hotelling’s T2 test was applied. Moreover, the PCA model was performed including the QC
samples and, based on their tight clustering, it showed a good quality of the analysis in our batch.
Subsequently, a supervised analysis was applied. Orthogonal Partial Least Square (OPLS-DA) analysis
was employed to discriminate between patients with oligozoospermia and healthy patients, maximizing
the discrimination between samples assigned to different classes. The OPLS-DA model removes
variability not relevant to class separation [25,26].
The variance and the predictive ability (R2X, R2Y, Q2
) were established to evaluate the suitability
of the models. In addition, to avoid OPLS-DA-derived model over-fitting, permutation tests with 400
iterations using the 7-fold cross-validation method were performed. In short, this rigorous test compares
the goodness of fit of the original model with that of randomly permuted models [27]. The permutation
test provides model validity in terms of the explained variance parameter (R2
) and the cross-validation
parameter (Q2
) that indicates the goodness of fit and accuracy of prediction, respectively, in the
supervised model. In parallel, CV-ANOVA (analysis of variance testing of cross-validated predictive
residuals) tests were performed to determine significant differences between oligozoospermia and the
healthy control group in the OPLS-DA models (p < 0.05). To evaluate the predictive and diagnostic
ability of the model, external validation was carried out. About half of the total samples (15 healthy
controls and nine oligozoospermias) were randomly selected from each group as the test set, and the
remaining part of the samples (14 healthy controls and nine oligozoospermias) constituted the training
set for validation. An ROC curve was created using the cross-validated predicted Y-values of the
1H-NMR OPLS-DA data.
Variables corresponding to a VIP (Variables Important in the Projection) value of >1 (a measure of
their relative influence on the model, see supplementary material) from the OPLS-DA model together
with the Volcano plot (plot constructed with the VIP value versus p(corr)), were indicated as the
most significant in discriminating between the metabolic profiles of oligozoospermia and healthy
controls. Indeed, VIPs of >1 are the most relevant for explaining Y (assignment of two classes). To
study a possible linear relationship between the metabolic profile (matrix X, predictor variables, e.g.,
metabolites) and the clinical parameters (matrix Y, dependent variable, age, motility of spermatozoa,
progressive motility and % of “in situ” motility), PLS projection to latent structures regression models
were carried out [28].
Subsequently, the variables were identified using the Chenomx NMR Suite 7.1 (Chenomx Inc.,
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) [29] and literature data. GraphPad Prism software (version 7.01, GraphPad
Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to perform the univariate statistical analysis of the
data resulting from the multivariate analysis. To verify the significance of the resulting metabolites, a
U-Mann Whitney test was performed, followed by ROC curves to test the sensitivity and specificity
of the metabolites with p-values <0.05. ROC curves are conventionally used to evaluate diagnostic
performance in clinical research. Finally, once the significant metabolites were selected, a Spearman
Correlation was performed between each selected significant metabolite and clinical parameters (total
spermatozoa, total motile spermatozoa, age, % of motility of spermatozoa, % of progressive motility
and % of “in situ” motility).

indicated proper modelling. Additionally, to test the power of the model, about half of the total

and the corresponding cross-validated predicted Y-values were used to create the ROC curve
(Figure 2C, AUC=0.9, CI=0.75–1, p =0.002). The respective box plot indicates the difference of the
values based on the classes of samples (p=0.0009).

To test a possible linear correlation between the whole metabolic profile of the patients and
clinical parameters such as age, % of motility of spermatozoa, % progressive motility and % of “in
situ” motility, PLS models were performed. The analysis showed no linear correlation with all the
parameters, indeed, the R2 values were <0.2 for each model (Figure S3).
Finally, the Spearman correlation was applied to fructose, choline, aspartate and myo-inositol and
the following clinical parameters: total spermatozoa, total motile spermatozoa, age, % of motility of
spermatozoa, % of progressive motility and % of “in situ” motility”. In Figure 5, correlation plots for

4. Discussion
The identification and quantification of biomarkers were achieved through a combination of
analytical, biochemical and spectral analysis, thereby establishing signatures of the metabolites for
healthy control populations and cases with specific illnesses. The simplest and fastest approaches to
distinguish oligozoospermic men from controls utilize classification methods, resulting in a predictive
model that can categorize each man based on his NMR spectra, creating unique metabolome profiles
that help to differentiate patients from controls. Moreover, the metabolomics approach allowed the
identification of a set of specific metabolites which have been tested as biomarkers with the analysis
of sensitivity and specificity. In our data, aspartate, choline, fructose and myo-inositol (MYO) were
identified as the most relevant to classify and characterize men affected by oligozoospermia. Finally,
the metabolites were correlated with clinical parameters of the patients, such as total spermatozoa, total
motile spermatozoa, age, % of motility of spermatozoa, % of progressive motility, and % of “in situ”
motility to investigate a possible association. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have been
performed with the metabolomics approach [30] on a cohort of patients affected by oligozoospermia
and, for this reason, it is not simple to explain the biological meaning of the metabolites by comparing
our study with others. Zhao et al. applied an untargeted GC-MS analysis on patients affected by
idiopathic asthenozoospermia, and they found a different panel of altered metabolites compared with
our study based on the different analytical technique used [31]. Moreover, Jayaraman et al. performed
an NMR analysis of seminal fluids of patients with different forms of male infertility, highlighting the
presence of a difference in biochemical profiles, with a specific emphasis on idiopathic infertility where
the level of lysine could be of diagnostic use [17].
In our analysis, fructose played a leading role in the separation of the two classes. It is known that
the seminal vesicles produce and secrete reducing substances (fructose, ascorbic acid, ergothioneine) [32].
Fructose is essential for spermatozoa metabolism and motility as an energy source. For this reason,
fructose is routinely assayed in almost all laboratories of andrology and could be used as a marker
of the function of seminal vesicles. In our data, higher concentrations of fructose were found in
oligozoospermic patients compared to control patients. Gonzales et al. found similar results comparing
the same classes of patients [33]. In all likelihood, due to the low number of spermatozoa in the seminal
fluids of oligozoospermic patients, fructose was found to be increased because it was not employed as
fuel for motility of spermatozoa. It is demonstrated also by the results of the Spearman correlation
where fructose appeared negatively correlated with the total number of spermatozoa and the total
motile spermatozoa. Discordant results were found in literature: in particular, seminal fructose content
correlated inversely with sperm count but not with sperm motility [34].

Myo-inositol is a biomolecule particularly studied in the field of medically assisted reproduction
as it regulates a wide range of cellular processes (gamete development, oocyte maturation, fertilization
and early embryonic development) [35]. Indeed, an increasing number of studies have supported the
physiological and therapeutic role of MYO in human reproductive functions [36,37]. Previous evidence
has suggested a possible role of MYO in spermatogenesis and sperm function. In animal models, a
lower concentration of MYO within the epididymis has been associated with reduced fertility [38]
and moreover, in humans, the enzyme MYO monophosphatase-1 is present in greater amounts in
spermatozoa from asthenozoospermic samples [39]. Interesting, Colone et al. [40] recently showed that
the spermatozoa of patients with oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) are covered by amorphous
fibrous material that increases seminal fluid viscosity and reduces sperm motility. Moreover, the
mitochondria in the intermediate tract of spermatozoa of patients with OAT showed damaged cristae.
Surprisingly, after incubation with inositol, the amorphous fibrous material disappeared and cristae
damage decreased. Thereafter, spermatozoa from patients with OAT appeared similar to those obtained
from normozoospermic men [40]. In line with our results, Condorelli at al. [41] found that MYO
significantly improved the total and progressive motility of the sperm from the patients with OAT,
while these parameters were unaffected in the spermatozoa of normozoospermic men. Incubation with
MYO improved sperm progressive motility and doubled the concentration of motile spermatozoa [41].
Furthermore, MYO concentration increases with movement of the spermatozoa through epididymis
and deferent duct [42].
Moreover, relating to the role of MYO in male reproduction, Chauvin et al. demonstrated that MYO
concentration in the seminiferous tubules is higher than in serum [43], highlighting its fundamental
role in this anatomical area, especially during reproduction [44].
The other significant metabolite change in oligozoospermic patients was choline. In line with our
result, Zhang et al. [45] found in the seminal plasma of patients with asthenozoospermia relatively higher
levels of phospholipids intermediates including choline, phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine.
Choline and its derivatives form important cell membrane constituents and play a pivotal role in
lipid cholesterol transport and metabolism. In our study, the altered levels of choline in the seminal
plasma of patients with oligozoospermia compared to control class suggested an altered choline
metabolism associated with this pathological condition. Muncu et al. [46] analyzed a cohort of patients
with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) by high-resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy to reveal the
metabolomic changes of seminal plasma compared to a control class. The levels of citrate, choline,
spermine, putrescine, α-ketoglutaric acid, valine, and tyrosine were significantly different between
the two groups. Further to this, levels of lactate, creatinine, lysine, arginine, and glutamine were also
statistically significant. In particular, they found a decreased concentration of choline in OAT patients,
in contrast with our findings.
Aspartate was found to decrease in patients affected by oligozoospermia. Moreover, in our
analysis, it correlated positively with the total amount of spermatozoa and the total motile spermatozoa.
High concentrations of aspartate have been found in Leydig cells [47,48] in rat testis fluid and in
epididymal spermatozoa [49]. Interestingly, it was found that, in humans, a considerable amount of
aspartate is present in seminal plasma and in spermatozoa, and its concentration in seminal plasma from
oligoasthenoteratospermic donors is significantly reduced when compared to normospermic donors.
Moreover, the concentration of aspartate in the spermatozoa reflects that found in seminal plasma [50].
The hypothesis proposed by this cited work could also be linked to our results; aspartate occurs in
seminal plasma and spermatozoa in relation to the quality of the semen. Because in normospermic
patients the concentration of aspartate is significantly higher than that of oligozoospermic patients, the
hypothesis is that aspartate could have a specific role in spermatogenesis. In fact, it is possible that the
amino acid could be implicated in the maturation and fertility of the spermatic cells.
In conclusion, the NMR-based metabolomics approach allowed the identification of a specific
metabolic fingerprint of the seminal fluids of patients affected by oligozoospermia. The identification
of a panel of metabolites (fructose, choline, aspartate and myo-inositol) proved useful in describing

this pathological state and may provide new avenues for the management of this serious condition.
Considering the absence of studies focussing on metabolic changes in the field of male sterility, further
investigation is necessary.
