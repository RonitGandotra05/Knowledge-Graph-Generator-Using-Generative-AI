background: Male infertility affects .20 million men worldwide and represents a major health concern. Although multifactorial, male
infertility has a strong genetic basis which has so far not been extensively studied. Recent studies of consanguineous families and of small
cohorts of phenotypically homogeneous patients have however allowed the identification of a number of autosomal recessive causes of teratozoospermia. Homozygous mutations of aurora kinase C (AURKC) were first described to be responsible for most cases of macrozoospermia.
Other genes defects have later been identified in spermatogenesis associated 16 (SPATA16) and dpy-19-like 2 (DPY19L2) in patients with globozoospermia and more recently in dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 1 (DNAH1) in a heterogeneous group of patients presenting with flagellar abnormalities previously described as dysplasia of the fibrous sheath or short/stump tail syndromes, which we propose to call multiple morphological
abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF).

methods: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature available in PubMed/Medline was conducted for studies on human genetics,
experimental models and physiopathology related to teratozoospermia in particular globozoospermia, large headed spermatozoa and flagellar
abnormalities. The search included all articles with an English abstract available online before September 2014.
results: Molecular studies of numerous unrelated patients with globozoospermia and large-headed spermatozoa confirmed that mutations
in DPY19L2 and AURKC are mainly responsible for their respective pathological phenotype. In globozoospermia, the deletion of the totality of the
DPY19L2 gene represents 81% of the pathological alleles but point mutations affecting the protein function have also been described. In macrozoospermia only two recurrent mutations were identified in AURKC, accounting for almost all the pathological alleles, raising the possibility of a
putative positive selection of heterozygous individuals. The recent identification of DNAH1 mutations in a proportion of patients with MMAF is
promising but emphasizes that this phenotype is genetically heterogeneous. Moreover, the identification of mutations in a dynein strengthens the
emerging point of view that MMAF may be a phenotypic variation of the classical forms of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Based on data from human and
animal models, the MMAF phenotype seems to be favored by defects directly or indirectly affecting the central pair of axonemal microtubules of
the sperm flagella.
conclusions: The studies described here provide valuable information regarding the genetic and molecular defects causing infertility, to
improve our understanding of the physiopathology of teratozoospermia while giving a detailed characterization of specific features of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, these findings have a significant influence on the diagnostic strategy for teratozoospermic patients allowing the clinician to
provide the patient with informed genetic counseling, to adopt the best course of treatment and to develop personalized medicine directly targeting the defective gene products.
Key words: male infertility / teratozoospermia / genetic diagnosis / sperm morphology / gene mutations
Introduction
Infertility, observed after 12 months of regular sexual intercourse, is a
major health issue with at least 9% of couples requiring medical assistance
to conceive a child (Boivin et al., 2007). It is therefore estimated to
concern 72.4 million couples worldwide with 40.5 million currently
seeking medical care (Boivin et al., 2007). In half of these cases, spermatograms identify a reduced sperm quantity or quality, suggesting that a
male factor is present, alone, or in conjunction with a female cause, in
half of the concerned couples (Thonneau et al., 1991; Poongothai
et al., 2009; Krausz, 2011). The diagnosis of male infertility is often
merely descriptive, the etiology of the sperm defect remaining idiopathic
in 30 –50% of cases (Krausz, 2011; Tu¨ttelmann et al., 2011b). One of the
reasons for this lack of fundamental understanding is the heterogeneity of
causal factors, as male infertility is a typical multifactorial disorder
(Brugo-Olmedo et al., 2001). Genetic factors are however likely to be
very frequent as it has been estimated that a genetic origin of male infertility could be found in nearly 1 in 40 men (Tu¨ttelmann et al., 2011a).
Chromosomal aberrations (mainly 47,XXY—Klinefelter syndrome),
microdeletions of the Y chromosome and cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CTFR) mutations have been unambiguously
demonstrated to be recurrent genetic causes of male infertility (Popli
and Stewart, 2007; Vogt et al., 2008; Jungwirth et al., 2012). Despite
this, routine screening for these well-established genetic causes (in principle justified only for patients presenting with certain specific phenotypes) results in a diagnosis in ,5% of all phenotypes (Nieschlag et al.,
2010). We can therefore safely assume that the bulk of the genetic
causes of male infertility is still uncharacterized, likely due to the large
number of genes involved (Matzuk and Lamb, 2002) and the lack of ambitious studies carried out on large cohorts of affected men.
Over the past years the genetic investigations of severe teratozoospermias has been one of the most productive areas within the topic of
male infertility and recurrent mutations have been identified in three specific phenotypes, which are macrozoospermia, globozoospermia and
multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) (Fig. 1).
Teratozoospermia is defined as a percentage of morphologically
normal spermatozoa below the lower reference limit. Cut-off values
for normality varied greatly in recent decades from 50% in the first
World Health Organization (WHO) classification (WHO, 1980) to
4% in the last version published in 2010 (Ombelet et al., 1995; World
Health Organization 2010). This traditional definition of teratozoospermia is based on the identification of atypical sperm shapes in sperm
smears thereby excluding ultrastructural defects invisible under light
microscope (Kruger et al., 1986). Chemes and collaborators proposed
to revisit this concept taking into consideration ultrastructural sperm
anomalies underlying their functional incompetence. This new approach
pushes back the limits of the definition of teratozoospermia beyond the
mere description of spermatozoa morphology (Chemes and Rawe,
2003; Chemes and Alvarez Sedo, 2012). Such examination is however
not compatible with the routine semen examination carried out in reproductive clinics. Teratozoospermia represents a heterogeneous group including a wide range of abnormal sperm phenotypes affecting, solely or
simultaneously, the head, neck, midpiece and tail. Distinctions should
also be made between specific forms with a homogenous monomorphic
phenotype shared between several patients and forms with heterogeneous sperm anomalies (non-specific) randomly distributed in each individual and among different patients (Chemes and Rawe, 2003).
Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) is one of the most common
phenotypes of male infertility. It is defined by a combination of qualitative
and quantitative sperm defects (Jungwirth et al., 2012). Due to a high
phenotypic variability, genetic causes of OAT have not been clearly identified and remain so far largely unknown. Many genetic association
studies reported numerous variants associated with OAT, the validity
of which remains to be established. Many knockout mice have also
been described to present with OAT (Matzuk and Lamb, 2008). No
mutations have however been identified in their human orthologs with
the exception of CAMK4 which was mutated in two patients with
OAT (Khattri et al., 2012). A candidate gene approach also allowed
the identification of a double amino-substitution in NANOS1, a gene
that is apparently not required for spermatogenesis in the mouse
456 Coutton et al.

(Haraguchi et al., 2003), in one man with OAT (Kusz-Zamelczyk et al.,
2013). These mutations however, were not formally functionally validated and no further studies confirmed their implication in OAT.
Abnormalities of the sperm flagella always induce asthenozoospermia.
They present highly variable morphological defects which can also affect
the head and are sometimes associated with oligozoospermia. As such,
some patients can be classified as a subgroup of OAT. A mosaic of different flagellar abnormalities is usually observed within the same spermogram including absent, short, bent, angulated or irregular flagella with
also a high incidence of head defects. This phenotype has previously
been reported as ‘short tails’ or ‘stump tails’ (Neugebauer et al., 1990;
Baccetti et al., 1993; Stalf et al., 1995; Da´vila Garza and Patrizio, 2013)
or dysplasia of the fibrous sheath (David et al., 1993; Olmedo et al.,
1997, 2000; Chemes et al., 1998; Rawe et al., 2001; Moretti et al.,
2011; Ghedir et al., 2014). As none of the previous terms seem to accurately define this phenotype because these patients’ flagella present with a
mosaic of ultrastructural flagellar defects as well as of morphological abnormalities including short tails but also, bent, curled, thick and missing
flagella we previously proposed to call this heterogeneous group of subjects ‘MMAF’ for multiple morphological anomalies of the flagella (Ben
Khelifa et al., 2014). We will use here this descriptive definition for this
heterogeneous phenotype. These flagellum morphological defects are
however unevenly reported or are sometimes only observed in a small
fraction of patient’s spermatozoa. Some gene defects have been identified which seem to induce such phenotypes including mutations in solute
carrier family 26 (SLC26A8) or septin 12 (SEPT12) identified in a subset of
patients with asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia including a bent
tail and/or a round head with an abnormal acrosome (Kuo et al., 2012;
Lin et al., 2012; Dirami et al., 2013). These genes were described as being
involved in the organization of the septin rings forming the annulus.Other
patients have been studied presenting a more severe phenotype with
close to 100% abnormalities and mutations in DNAH1, a gene coding
for an inner dynein arm protein, identified in 28% of the patients analyzed (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014).
Other phenotypes can be considered as pure teratozoospermia with
100% abnormal sperm and with a constant uniform pattern of anomalies,
such as globozoospermia, large-headed multiflagellar spermatozoa or
acephalic spermatozoa. To date, several genes were identified in most
of these specific teratozoospermia in humans. The identification and
study of these genes shed a much-needed light on the physiopathology

of teratozoospermia, as a prerequisite to improve the patient management, to provide a basis for the development of therapeutic solutions tailored to the gene defect and to provide the patients with adequate
genetic counseling and expected treatment outcome. Moreover, since
the investigation of gene function in human is difficult, the elucidation
of the function of mutated genes and identification of possible candidate
genes in animal models is crucial for the identification of factors affecting
male fertility. Numerous animal models, and in particular mutant mouse
models related to teratozoospermia, have been extensively described in
the literature (for review Yan, 2009; De Boer et al., 2015). In this review
we focus on specific teratozoospermic phenotypes for which a recurrent
and reliable genetic cause has been identified in human. We provide an
update of the genetic etiology of these phenotypes, summarize their
underlying molecular mechanisms and detail the clinical implications
arising from these findings.
Methods
A computerized literature search was conducted for all publications in
PubMed/Medline until September 2014. We searched using the following
MeSH or key word terms: teratozoospermia (402 records) OR globozoospermia (114 records) OR large-headed spermatozoa (35 records) OR
macrozoospermia (3 records) OR macrocephalic sperm head syndrome
(8 records) OR short tail sperm (187 records) OR stump tail sperm (22
records) OR dysplasia fibrous sheath (39 records) OR primary flagellar abnormalities (22 records)OR primary ciliary dyskinesia (2135 records)OR flagellum biogenesis (260 records) with a possible combination with the
keywords genetics, animal models, knockout, diagnosis and ICSI. Any additional relevant articles identified from the bibliography of the initially
retrieved articles and reviews were then included (24 records). Only Englishlanguage publications or articles in other languages, but with a sufficiently
detailed abstract in English were included. Additionally, we have opted to
focus on articles regarding specific teratozoospermia phenotypes for which
a gene was formally identified in human in several non-related individuals
thereby reducing the risk of erroneous diagnosis. Heterogeneous phenotypes such as OAT (249 records) or pure phenotypes but with no identified
genetic cause such as ‘decapitated spermatozoa’ (46 records) were not
included in this review. Last, we did not include studies describing the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a particular
phenotype (588 records) as we believe that many of these reports may
have a low level of evidence. Concerning animal models, we selected a restrictive list of knockout (KO) models among every mutant model described
in the literature related to infertility and in particular teratozoospermia (1160
records) (for exhaustive review see Yan, 2009; De Boer et al., 2015). Only
KO mice with a globozoospermia-like phenotype (14 records), mutant
mice with inactivated aurora kinase (Aurk)c, Aurkb and dynein axonemal
heavy chain 1 (Dnah1) genes (17 records) and mice with central pair microtubule defects leading to flagellar abnormalities (10 records) are presented in
this review.
Large headed multiflagellar
spermatozoa
Patients with large-headed multiflagellar spermatozoa (MIM 243060),
named also macrozoospermia or macrocephalic sperm head syndrome,
present with a primary infertility characterized by the presence in the
ejaculate of 100% abnormal spermatozoa with an oversized irregular
head, abnormal midpiece and acrosome, and multiple flagella (Fig. 1B).
Ultrastructural study of such spermatozoa revealed a 3-fold increase in
nuclear volume and on average 3.6 flagella for each sperm head
(Escalier, 1983). This teratozoospermia is also generally associated
with a severe oligoasthenozoospermia (Escalier, 1983; Benzacken
et al., 2001; Devillard et al., 2002). This spectacular phenotype has
been regularly described in the scientific literature since its initial description 37 years ago (Nistal et al., 1977; German et al., 1981; Escalier, 1983;
In’t Veldetal., 1997; Pieters et al., 1998;Kahraman et al., 1999;Benzacken
et al., 2001; Devillard et al., 2002; Guthauser et al., 2006; Mateu et al.,
2006; Perrin et al., 2008; Chelli et al., 2010; Brahem et al., 2012).
Aneuploidy and abnormal morphology:
AURKC is the key
Several studies using Feulgen-stained preparations (German et al., 1981),
spermatocyte C-banding (Pieters et al., 1998) and mainly fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed a high rate of polyploidy and aneuploidy in spermatozoa from men with macrozoospermia. In these
reports, the number of spermatozoa interpreted as haploid varied
from 0 to 10.9%, as diploid from 19.8 to 60%, as triploid from 10 to
62.4% and as tetraploid from 5.1 to 36% (Yurov et al., 1996; In’t Veld
et al., 1997; Weissenberg et al., 1998; Viville et al., 2000; Benzacken
et al., 2001; Devillard et al., 2002; Lewis-Jones et al., 2003; Vicari et al.,
2003; Guthauser et al., 2006; Mateu et al., 2006; Achard et al., 2007;
Perrin et al., 2008; Chelli et al., 2010; Brahem et al., 2012). Partial
forms of this syndrome have been described with various percentages
of large-headed spermatozoa. These ‘mosaic’ forms showed a percentage of euploid spermatozoa roughly correlated with their ratio of
normally-sized gametes (Vicari et al., 2003; Achard et al., 2007;
Brahem et al., 2012). Taken together, these observations provide evidence indicating that chromosome nondisjunction and/or cytokinesis
defects occurring during the first, the second or both meiotic divisions
are consistently associated with large-headed spermatozoa (Escalier
et al., 1992; In’t Veld et al., 1997; Weissenberg et al., 1998; Benzacken
et al., 2001; Devillard et al., 2002).
A description of familial cases with consanguineous parents was suggestive of a genetic cause with an autosomal recessive inheritance. In
2007, a genome-wide low-density microsatellite analysis led to the identification of a common region of homozygosity in 7 out of 10 North
African macrozoospermic patients, located in the terminal region of
chromosome 19 long arm. The AURKC gene, localized in the center of
this region, appeared as the ideal candidate because it was described
as being expressed preferentially in male germ cells and to be involved
in chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis (Fig. 2), two functions that
could explain the abnormal sperm morphology and cytogenetic
content of large-headed spermatozoa (Dieterich et al., 2007). Sequencing of the AURKC coding sequence allowed the identification of the
same homozygous deletion (c.144delC) in all 14 patients included in
the study. This mutation introduces a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination of translation and yielding a truncated protein lacking its conserved kinase domain (Dieterich et al., 2007). It was later demonstrated
that the mutated transcript is in fact degraded by the mechanism of nonsense mediated mRNA decay, thus indicating that these patients do not
even produce the truncated protein (Ben Khelifa et al., 2011). In another
study, using flow cytometry in AURKC-mutated patients, Dieterich et al.
(2009) demonstrated that all spermatozoa had a homogenous tetraploid
DNA content indicating that patient’ germ cells undergo DNA synthesis
but remain blocked without completing either of the two meiotic
458 Coutton et al.

divisions (Fig. 2). These results were discordant with previous FISH
studies, which showed a wide heterogeneity of chromosomal abnormalities. The authors indicated that this difference is mainly due to the limits
of the FISH technique and that in these abnormal gametes the superposition of FISH signals led to a great underestimate of the number of chromosomes/chromatids (Dieterich et al., 2009). Surprisingly, in spite of
this meiotic arrest, spermiogenesis is not blocked suggesting that
meiotic checkpoint controls are abolished or inefficient in these patients.
Most macrozoospermic patients however present a severely reduced
sperm count concordant with the mathematical reduction in sperm
number due to the absence of cell division and a partial effect of the
meiotic checkpoints (Ben Khelifa et al., 2011).
AURKC function in meiotic cells: between
specificities and complementarities
AURKC belongs to the Aurora kinases family, which are highly evolutionary conserved serine/threonine kinases playing a key role in the control
of mitosis and meiosis. In Mammals, aurora kinases also comprise two
other family members, aurora kinase (AURKA) and aurora kinase B
(AURKB). The three kinases share a high sequence homology in their
central kinase domain and have a common ortholog in Drosophila and
yeast (Sunkel and Glover, 1988; Chan and Botstein, 1993; Glover
et al., 1995). Despite their similarities, the three Aurora kinases have distinct localizations and functions. Divergences in the N-terminal domains
of these proteins confer specific protein –protein interactions abilities
(Carmena and Earnshaw, 2003). AURKA and B play distinct roles
during mitosis: AURKA controls centrosome maturation, bipolar assembly and chromosome separation while AURKB regulates chromosome
segregation, kinetochore –microtubule interaction and cytokinesis
(Goldenson and Crispino, 2014). Much less is known about AURKC
which was described more recently. AURKC recently evolved from
AURKB after gene duplication (Brown et al., 2004), and therefore
shares a high degree of homology with AURKB (73%). AURKC is
expressed predominantly in testis, in particular in dividing spermatocytes, and in oocytes whereas AURKA and B are expressed ubiquitously
(Bernard et al., 1998; Tseng et al., 1998; Assou et al., 2006; Tang et al.,
2006; Yang et al., 2010). AURKC has also been described as highly
expressed in early human preimplantation embryos (Avo Santos et al.,
2011). There are several lines of evidence that strongly suggest that
AURKC can function in place of AURKB in meiotic cells. First, AURKC
function can overlap with AURKB as evidenced by the fact that
AURKC could rescue AURKB-depleted somatic cells (Li et al., 2004;
Sasai et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2005). This was also supported by the fact
Figure 2 AURKC controls meiosis and spermatocyte cytokinesis.
Genetic causes of teratozoospermia 459

that AURKC is sufficient to drive mitotic progression during early embryonic divisions in preimplantation mouse embryos lacking AURKB
(Ferna´ndez-Miranda et al., 2011). The study of KO mice also demonstrated a respective functional compensation of both kinases during
meiosis and embryonic development (Ferna´ndez-Miranda et al., 2011;
Schindler et al., 2012). Moreover, it has been reported that AURKC,
like AURKB, is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex
(CPC) with a similar localization and interaction with other subunits
such as inner centromere protein antigens 135/155 kDa (INCENP), survivin (BIRC5) and Borealin (CDCA8) (Chen et al., 2005; Vader et al.,
2008).CPC is a pivotal regulator of mitotic events including chromosome
segregation and cytokinesis (Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004). During
chromosome alignment, CPC corrects chromosome-microtubule attachment errors generating temporarily unattached kinetochores, a condition sensed by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (Vader et al.,
2008; Carmena et al., 2012; van der Waal et al., 2012; van der Horst
and Lens, 2014). The SAC represents one of the main mechanisms of
cell division control ensuring fidelity in chromosome segregation. It verifies whether prerequisites for chromosome segregation have been met
and thereby determines whether to execute or to delay chromosome
segregation (Musacchio and Hardwick, 2002; Zhou et al., 2002). In addition it has been demonstrated that Aurora kinases could contribute to
recruiting different mitotic checkpoint components such as BUB1
mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase (BUB1) to the kinetochore
(Becker et al., 2010; van derWaal et al., 2012). Impairment of CPC functions results in chromosome segregation defects, altered SAC and cytokinesis failure. Such perturbations in mitosis can lead to the production of
aneuploid/polyploid cells, which then often become malignant. By comparison, abnormalities in CPC during meiosis are expected to lead to the
production of chromosomally unbalanced gametes (Sharif et al., 2010;
Yang et al., 2010; van der Waal et al., 2012; van der Horst and Lens,
2014).
Many experimental studies tried to address AURKB and AURKC specific functions during meiosis. They have so far been largely hampered by
the difficulty to selectively inhibit one of the two kinases (Schindler et al.,
2012; Balboula and Schindler, 2014). Only one study supports a preponderant role of AURKB in mouse spermatogenesis based on the study of
AURKB transgenic mice, which are shown to be subfertile due to abnormal spermatocytes, increased testicular apoptosis and spermatogenic
arrest. The authors however acknowledged that the function of
AURKC might also be altered in their AURKB transgenic mutants
(Kimmins et al., 2007). KO strategies did not prove more useful because
homozygous Aurkc KO mice do not perfectly mimic the typical human
macrozoospermia phenotype. Unlike infertile AURKC-mutated men, KO
Aurkc male mice are fertile but with reduced litter size. They have
normal testis weight and sperm count but do produce abnormal spermatozoa. Sperm abnormalities include abnormal chromatin condensation,
acrosome loss and blunted heads (Kimmins et al., 2007). It is possible
that the milder phenotype observed in mouse compared with human
may be due to a greater overlap of AURKB and C functions in mouse
than in human spermatogenesis but this remains to be demonstrated.
The function of AURKC has been extensively studied in oocytes. In
female mice, the overexpression of a dominant negative allele inhibiting
the AURKC activity (AURKC-DN) in oocytes was shown to cause cytokinesis failure in meiosis I resulting in the production of large polyploid
oocytes, a pattern similar to that observed in AURKC-deficient human
spermatozoa (Yang et al., 2010). These results are however questionable
as AURKB might also be down-regulated in this mouse model (Schindler
et al., 2012). Mice oocytes express both AURKB and C and this double
expression might provide a backup ensuring the maintaining of critical
functions (i.e. SAC and cytokinesis) in a transcriptionally quiescent cell
(Schindler et al., 2012). Aurkc KO female mice however are subfertile
with fewer pups per litter compared with wild type (5.5 versus 7.5
pups, on average per liter), and furthermore their oocytes show a
higher incidence of chromosome misalignment and often arrest at
meiosis I or later on at the 1-cell stage (Schindler et al., 2012). Balboula
and Schindler (2014), using a specific catalytically inactive Aurkc
mutant (AURKC-LA), show that most AURKC-LA oocytes arrest at
metaphase I suggesting that AURKC-CPC is not the sole CPC
complex that regulates the SAC in female meiosis. A small percentage
of oocytes proceeded through meiosis and induced cytokinesis normally
but were aneuploid, indicating that AURKC-CPC is the critical CPC
complex necessary to correct improper chromosome-microtubule
attachments during meiosis, a central role for preventing aneuploidy
(Balboula and Schindler, 2014). These data indicate that the absence
of AURKC is compatible with reproduction but might have an impact
during meiosis and/or embryonic development. In human the absence
of AURKC is compatible with female reproduction as women with
homozygous AURKC mutations were shown to be fertile (Dieterich
et al., 2009). Women with homozygous AURKC mutations could
however be subfertile and present an increased risk of miscarriages in relation to the production of aneuploid oocytes. Further studies on the fertility of women with homozygous AURKC mutations should be carried
out to conclude on this point.
Lastly, AURKC is expressed at a very low level in other somatic cells
types such as brain glial cells, lung, placenta (Yan et al., 2005; Ferna´ndezMiranda et al., 2011) or the pineal gland where it has been implicated in
circadian clock function in the rat (Price et al., 2009). Apart from infertility, homozygous AURKC-mutated patients display no other clinical features suggesting that AURKC is dispensable in somatic cells (Dieterich
et al., 2007, 2009). AURKC is also aberrantly expressed in some
cancer cells but its contribution to oncogenesis is not well explored
and understood (Khan et al., 2011; Tsou et al., 2011; Zekri et al.,
2012; Goldenson and Crispino, 2014).
AURKC mutations: the c.144delC reigns
supreme
The genotype of macrozoospermic patients described in the literature is
summarized in (Table I). The c.144delC deletion accounts for 85% of
the mutated alleles (Ben Khelifa et al., 2012). Other mutations have been
identified: p.C229Y, a novel missense mutation in exon 6 and c.144delC
(Dieterich et al., 2009), p.Y248*, a new recurrent non-sense mutation
was found in 10 unrelated individuals of European and North African
origin (Ben Khelifa et al., 2012) and c436-2A.G, leading to a shortened
transcript devoid of exon 5 (Ben Khelifa et al., 2011). Overall, and excluding the study of Eloualid (2014) based on an unselected population of infertile men, a positiveAURKCmutation diagnosis is found in between 50.8
and 100% of analyzed macrozoospermic patients (Table I).
Nearly all positive mutated AURKC patients have a typical phenotype,
with close to 100% large-head spermatozoa, whereas negative patients
have a lower percentage of large-headed spermatozoa (,75%) (Table II)
(Dieterich et al., 2009). Positive hits are strongly correlated with the percentage of large-headed spermatozoa in the ejaculate (Table II). No

Genetic causes of teratozoospermia 461
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/21/4/455/684509 by guest on 18 February 2025
mutation was generally found in patients with ,70% of macrocephalic
spermatozoa (Dieterich et al., 2009; Ben Khelifa et al., 2011, 2012;
El Kerch et al., 2011; Eloualid et al., 2014). Furthermore, although the
large majority of men with macrozoospermia present a reduced sperm
count, men with extreme oligozoospermia (,0.5 M/ml) were usually
not carriers of AURKC mutations.
To date Aurora kinase C remains the only gene where mutations were
found in patients with a large-headed spermatozoa phenotype. The sequencing of AURKC exons 3 and 6 to search for the two recurrent mutations is appropriate as a first-line genetics test in all patients presenting
with large-headed spermatozoa. The sequencing of the remaining
exons should be discussed in light of the values of semen parameters.
In fact, a sperm concentration .1 million, a percentage of large-head
spermatozoa beyond 70% and/or a low percentage of normal spermatozoa (,1%) are in favor of a positive outcomes (Table II) (Ben Khelifa et al.,
2012). Others parameters could be taken into account like the presence
of multiple flagella. As an example, Molinari et al. (2013) reported a case
of sperm macrocephaly syndrome with 95% of large-headed spermatozoa but without tail abnormalities. AURKC gene sequencing did not reveal
any mutations in the patient, suggesting that other genes may be involved
in determining this atypical syndrome.
The c.144delC mutation accounts for almost all identified AURKC
mutations, in particular in a Magrebian population where the prevalence
of this mutation at a heterozygous state is estimated to be of 1 in 50
(Dieterich et al., 2009; Eloualid et al., 2014). Surprisingly, it makes
AURKC gene alterations the most frequent defect in infertile Magrebian
men before Klinefelter syndrome and Y-microdeletions (Ounis et al.,
2015). It is difficult to precisely calculate the p.Y248* prevalence in
North African individuals because the c.144delC is often the only mutation studied (Dieterich et al., 2009; El Kerch et al., 2011; Eloualid et al.,
2014). No reliable data are currently available for European individuals
due to a small number of studied patients. However, the recently identified non-sense mutation p.Y248* appears to be the main mutation in
individuals of European origin (Ben Khelifa et al., 2012). Both recurrent
mutations c.144delC and p.Y248* are founding mutations and ancestral
haplotypes were used to compute the age of the two AURKC mutations.
It was estimated that c.144delC occurred between 1350 and 1750 AD
and p.Y248* between 675 and 1075 AD. The fact that p.Y248* predates
c.144delC is confirmed by the observed wider geographical distribution
of p.Y248* (Ben Khelifa et al., 2012). It remains surprising that mutations
with a negative effect on reproduction should reach such a high prevalence. A possible explanation lies in the assumption that the heterozygous carriers of AURKC mutations may have a selective advantage
(Dieterich et al., 2007, 2009; Ben Khelifa et al., 2012; Ounis et al.,
2015). No clear demonstration of this putative selective advantage has
yet been provided and several hypotheses have been advanced.We previously described that AURKC was involved in the SAC. Men with
AURKC heterozygous mutations could therefore have a more relaxed
meiotic checkpoint permitting a faster meiosis turnover leading to an
increased sperm production (Ben Khelifa et al., 2012). The produced
gametes would however be expected to present a higher rate of aneuploidies likely to induce a high rate of spontaneous abortions. This hypothesis is supported by several observations of multiple miscarriages
or perinatal deaths in the siblings or parents of macrozoospermic
patients (Benzacken et al., 2001; Achard et al., 2007; Ounis et al., 2015).
Curiously, only four different AURKCmutations have been reported so
far, and all are involved in the complete form of the phenotype. Ben
Khelifa et al. (2012) propose that some mutations could affect only
some functions of the AURKC protein: the microtubule –kinetochore
attachment and/or cytokinesis, without altering AURKC SAC function.
The severity of the defects may depend on the level of kinase inhibition;
some functions of the CPC are already disturbed when the complex is
only partially inhibited (e.g. correction of microtubule –kinetochore attachment), while others (e.g. its function in the SAC) may require complete inhibition (van der Horst and Lens, 2014). This would therefore
lead to severe quantitative defects, and what could be considered as
‘milder’ AURKC mutations could be found in azoospermic rather than
in macrozoospermic patients. This hypothesis has however not been
confirmed yet.

spermatozoa due to the high frequency of sperm chromosomal abnormalities (Perrin et al., 2008). Management of patients diagnosed with
macrozoospermia should begin with AURKC diagnosis. ICSI will then
be formally contraindicated for all homozygous mutated patients
who can have recourse to donor sperm or adoption (Ben Khelifa
et al., 2011). Careful selection of ‘normal-looking spermatozoa’ by
motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) has previously been evaluated in several AURKC c.144delC deleted patients.
FISH analyses performed on all selected spermatozoa showed that all
were aneuploid, confirming that ICSI should not be attempted for
AURKC-mutated patients even after a very thorough morphological selection (Chelli et al., 2010). The prognosis is not as categorically unfavorable for patients not carrying AURKC mutations or with a
partial/atypical phenotype. Although low, the chances of pregnancy
are not negligible (Kahraman et al., 1999; Achard et al., 2007). For
these men, sperm FISH should be carried out to assess the rate of
euploid sperm and evaluate the probability of success. PGD can be
proposed for those with an intermediate rate of aneuploid sperm
(Kahraman et al., 2004; Dieterich et al., 2009). Careful scrutiny of the
pregnancy and of the perinatal period is however recommended in
case of success (Achard et al., 2007).
Globozoospermia
First described in human in 1971, globozoospermia (MIM 613958) is
a rare (incidence 0.1%) and severe form of teratozoospermia
characterized by the presence in the ejaculate of a large majority of
round spermatozoa lacking the acrosome (Fig. 1C) (Sen et al.,
1971; Holstein et al., 1973; Dam et al., 2007a). Globozoospermic
sperm are unable to adhere and penetrate the zona pellucida,
causing primary infertility (Dam et al., 2007a). The initial phenotype
was divided into two subtypes: the globozoospermia type I characterized by the complete lack of acrosome and acrosomal enzymes
and the globozoospermia type II characterized by a round-headed
phenotype due to a residual cytoplasmic droplet surrounding the
sperm head and acrosome (Anton-Lamprecht et al., 1976; Singh,
1992). However, this nomenclature is confusing and was subsequently
often misemployed in the literature referring to patients with a homogeneous phenotype with 100% round-headed sperm (type I) or patients
with a mosaic of normal and round-headed sperm (type II). The terms
‘total’ or ‘partial’ globozoospermia have been proposed and should
be preferred to report the homogeneity of the ‘original’ type I phenotype (Lerer-Goldshtein et al., 2010; Dam et al., 2011) while the rarer,
type II phenotype, should be referred as pseudo-globozoospermia.
Globozoospermia and experimental models:
a relevant strategy?
Several familial cases of globozoospermia suggested a genetic contribution to this disorder (Kullander and Rausing, 1975; Flo¨rke-Gerloff
et al., 1984; Dale et al., 1994; Kilani et al., 2004; Dirican et al., 2008).
This hypothesis was strengthened by the description in the literature

of KO mice with a globozoospermia-like phenotype lacking different
genes (Table III). Almost all these genes are ubiquitously expressed
and therefore do not appear as good candidates for the human globozoospermia phenotype, which only causes primary infertility. These
genes encode endoplasmic reticulum proteins such as heat shock
protein 90 kDa beta 1 (Hsp90b1) and glucosidase, beta (bile acid) 2
(Gba2) or vesicle trafficking-related proteins such as casein kinase 2,
alpha prime polypeptide (Csnk2a2), ArfGAP with FG repeats 1
(AGFG1 or Hrb), golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing
(Gopc), protein interacting with PRKCA 1 (Pick1), TATA element modulatory factor 1 (Tmf1), vacuolar protein sorting 54 (Vps54), small
ArfGAP 2 (Smap2) and autophagy related 7 (Atg7). All regulate proacrosomal vesicle transport from the Golgi to the acrosome (Table III
and Fig. 3). These proteins are implicated in a common pathway and
contribute to acrosome biogenesis and sperm head organization
(Fig. 3). Only zona pellucida binding protein (Zpbp or Zpbp1) and
sperm acrosome associated 1 (Spaca1) have an expression restricted
to the testis (Lin et al., 2007; Fujihara et al., 2012). Zpbp and Spaca1
are integral acrosomal proteins but display different functions (Lin
et al., 2007; Fujihara et al., 2012). Zpbp is localized in the acrosomal
matrix and is involved in the binding and penetration of the sperm
into the zona pellucida (Yatsenko et al., 2012) while Spaca1 is a transmembrane protein located in the inner acrosomal membrane of spermatids and mature spermatozoa (Fig. 3) and plays an unsolved role in
acrosomal morphogenesis and in sperm-egg binding and fusion (Hao
et al., 2002; Fujihara et al., 2012). None of these mouse models perfectly mirrors the round-shaped acrosomeless spermatozoa observed in
human globozoospermia. To date, .50 genetically modified mice
reported in the Mouse Genome Informatics database (http://www.
informatics.jax.org) contain in their phenotypic description a term
related to globozoospermia. This is not surprising in view of the complexity and the multitude of proteins involved in acrosome biogenesis
(Alvarez Sedo´ et al., 2012). In spite of this large list of mouse candidate
genes, only a few mutations have been identified in their human orthologs. Heterozygous missense and splicing mutations in ZPBP were
described in patients presenting with abnormal sperm head morphology, but their involvement in the disease has not been clearly demonstrated (Yatsenko et al., 2012). Similarly, a homozygous missense
mutation (G198A) in exon 13 of the PICK1 gene was identified in a
Chinese family (Liu et al., 2010). Again, the report of the identification
of a relatively mild mutation without any functional validation in a single
familial case remains somewhat unconvincing.
DPY19L2 mutational spectrum: toward a
diagnostic strategy
Gene candidate approaches, even with strong animal model data, are
often unsuccessful (Pirrello et al., 2005;Christensen et al., 2006). Homozygosity mapping using genome-wide scan analysis of a consanguineous
Ashkenazi Jewish family with three globozoospermic brothers identified
a homozygous mutation (c.848G.A) in SPATA16 (spermatogenesisassociated protein 16, previously named NYD-SP12) (Dam et al.,
2007b). The SPATA16 protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus and to
the proacrosomal vesicles which fuse to form the acrosome during spermiogenesis (Lu et al., 2006; Dam et al., 2007b). SPATA16, is highly
expressed in human testis and contains a conserved tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) domain (Xu et al., 2003) which may interact with the
GOPC and HRB proteins (Dam et al., 2007b). No mutation was subsequently found in 30 other patients with globozoospermia originating
from Europe or North Africa (Dam et al., 2007b), suggesting that
SPATA16 is not the main cause of globozoospermia, which is likely genetically heterogeneous. Only recently was a new SPATA16 mutation identified in single man from a large cohort of patients with globozoospermia
(Karaca et al., 2014). In 2011, from a cohort of 20 Tunisian patients with
100% globozoospermic sperm, SNP-based genetic linkage analysis identified a common region of homozygosity in 12q14.2 including the
dpy-19-like 2 (DPY19L2) gene strongly expressed in testis. A 200-kb
homozygous deletion of the DPY19L2 gene was found in 15 of the 20
patients analyzed (Harbuz et al., 2011). This deletion was also identified
in a second study published simultaneously in 19% (4 out of 21) of the
recruited globozoospermic patients (Koscinski et al., 2011). Although
the deletion frequency is very disparate, both studies conclude that the
DPY19L2 deletion is the main cause of globozoospermia. Subsequently,
three large studies confirmed the high prevalence of DPY19L2 gene
alterations, ranging from 60 to 83.3% of analyzed patients in cohorts of
globozoospermic patients from different geographic regions and with different ethnic backgrounds (Table IV) (Coutton et al., 2012; Elinati et al.,
2012;Zhu et al., 2013). A further two publications further strengthen this
conclusion, reporting the presence of homozygous DPY19L2 deletion in
patients from Macedonia and Algeria (Noveski et al., 2013; Ounis et al.,
2015). Homozygous deletions represent 26.7 to 73.3% of the reported
DPY19L2 mutations in the three largest studies (Table IV) (Coutton et al.,
2012; Elinati et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). This heterogeneous deletion
rate could be explained by a possible foundereffect in some studies with a
geographic-based recruitment accentuating the deletion prevalence
(Harbuz et al., 2011;Coutton et al., 2012; Elinati et al., 2012). In addition,
inclusion parameters are different and DPY19L2 mutations are mainly
identified in type I globozoospermia with a typical morphology and a
high percentage of affected spermatozoa (Table V) and the inclusion of
subjects with a low level of round-headed spermatozoa might in some
cases decrease diagnosis efficiency. The genotype-phenotype correlation is however not perfect, indicating that (i) some phenotypic variation
exists even within DPY19L2 deleted subjects and (ii) other gene defects
likely induce a pure globozoospermia phenotype (Table V). To enable a
better genotype/phenotype correlation great care should be taken to
respect the international recommendation for the examination of
human semen to standardize the results and avoid protocol variations
between the different laboratories (World Health Organization 2010).
Homozygous and compound heterozygous point mutations further
broaden the spectrum of DPY19L2-dependent globozoospermia
(Table IV). DPY19L2 point mutations can be either missense mutations
localized mainly in the central part of the DPY19L2 protein or nonsense/frameshift/splice-site mutations resulting in truncated proteins
(Coutton et al., 2012; Elinati et al., 2012;Zhu et al., 2013). Small deletions
were also reported (Table IV) indicating that exon deletions are part of
the mutational spectrum of theDPY19L2 gene (Zhu et al., 2013). A recurrent missense mutation in exon 8, p.Arg290His, was identified in several
unrelated patients. This mutation changes a highly conserved arginine
into a histidine and is predicted to be deleterious by multiple prediction
tools (Coutton et al., 2012; Elinati et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). Moreover, a recent study demonstrates that DPY-19, the DPY19L2 ortholog
in Caenorhabditis elegans, encodes a C-mannosyltransferase which is
able to glycosylate several target proteins using the lipid-linked glycoside
dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) as the donor substrate

(Buettner et al., 2013). Interestingly, the amino acid corresponding to the
Arg290 in C. elegans has been predicted to be involved in the binding of
the Dol-P moiety of the substrate (Buettner et al., 2013). These data
suggest that the arginine at position 290 could play a key role in
DPY19L2 function. The effect of this potential glycosylation remains to
be elucidated. On the whole, the fact that most reported missense mutations occur between exon 8 and 11 could indicate that this central
domain of DPY19L2 may support some critical functions.
Overall, the deletion of the totality of the DPY19L2 gene represents
about 81% of the pathological alleles (Table IV). Different approaches
have been described to effectively detect these DPY19L2 deletions.
First, a long-range PCR combined with exon-specific amplification is
the most widely used strategy to detect both homozygous and
heterozygous deletions (Table IV) (Harbuz et al., 2011; Koscinski et al.,
2011; Elinati et al., 2012; Noveski et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013). This
cost effective strategy allows delineating with a good accuracy the breakpoints of the genomic deletion although this information is not, strictly
speaking, useful for the diagnosis and clinically relevant. A strong shortcoming of this technique is that it does not detect the deletions with
breakpoints falling outside the region covered by the deletion-specific
primers therefore presenting a high risk of false-negative results
(Coutton et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). An alternative strategy is the
use of a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) approach to determine the number of DPY19L2 alleles for each patient,
and independently of the localization of the breakpoint (Coutton et al.,
2012). Drawbacks of MLPA are the relatively higher cost compared
with PCR approaches and the required experience for the design of
the MLPA specific probes to avoid cross-hybridization with DPY19L2
pseudogenes (Zhu et al., 2013). Considering these points, we recommend the research of homozygous and heterozygousDPY19L2 deletions
as the first-line genetic analysis in globozoospermic by long-range PCR or
MLPA (Coutton et al., 2012; Elinati et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). Alternatively a quantitative PCR protocol could be used (Chianese et al.,
2015). This approach does not rely on breakpoint localization and new
robust methods are becoming available which may provide a cheap
and fast diagnosis allowing the detection of all recombined alleles. In
almost all cases of globozoospermic patients with a heterozygous deletion, an additional point mutation in the non-deleted allele was secondly
identified (Coutton et al., 2012; Elinati et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). This
strongly encourages researching such a point mutation in globozoospermic patients heterozygous for the genomic deletion (Coutton et al.,
2012). In the absence of a deletion (heterozygous or homozygous) the
full 22 exon DPY19L2 sequencing might not be systematically realized
as a routine analysis. Similarly, the very low rate of mutations found in
others genes, such as SPATA16 or PICK1, questions the clinical relevance
of molecular investigations of such genes (Coutton et al., 2012). A ‘hotspots’ restrictive strategy based on the sequencing of theDPY19L2 exons
8–11, in which most of the point mutations were identified, could also be
envisaged. The genetic diagnosis of globozoospermia does not yet
provide any clear prognostic or therapeutic indications. Nonetheless, a
molecular diagnosis remains useful to provide adequate genetic counseling and to better understand the physiopathology of globozoospermia,
which might help to identify novel therapeutic solutions.
DPY19L2 functions: new insights on the
physiopathology of globozoospermia
DPY19L2 belongs to a new family of transmembrane proteins of the
nuclear envelope including, in Mammals, fours homologous proteins:
DPY19L1 to DPY19L4. Initially, inactivation of DPY-19, the only
DPY19L ortholog in C. elegans, was shown to induce a shorter
(dumpy) than wild-type phenotype (Brenner, 1974). DPY-19 has 10 predicted transmembrane domains and was involved in Q neuroblast polarization during early development (Honigberg and Kenyon, 2000). The
four human homologues have 9 –11 predicted transmembrane
domains, suggesting a similar protein structure to DPY-19 (Carson
et al., 2006). Moreover, human DPY19L proteins share a high level of sequence identity with DPY-19, consistent with a conservation of the ancestral protein function (Buettner et al., 2013). Functions of human
DPY19L proteins are still poorly understood and in particular for
Figure 3 Known proteins involved in acrosome biogenesis whose
functional absence leads to globozoospermia or globlozoospermia-like
phenotypes in mouse. Acrosome biogenesis includes several steps including protein processing within the reticulum, vesicle trafficking from
the Golgi apparatus, vesicle fusion, interaction of the inner acrosomal
membrane (IAMb) with the acroplaxome (Apx), interaction of the acroplaxome with the outer and inner nuclear membranes (ONM and INM)
of the nuclear envelope and maintaining integrity of the acrosomal
matrix. Numerous proteins are involved in these different steps and
their absence leads to defective acrosome biogenesis and globozoospermia or globozoospermia-like phenotypes. Only the absence of
sperm acrosome associated 1 (Spaca1) and Dpy19l2 leads to the disappearance of the nuclear dense lamina (NDL). Genes abbreviations
are as follows: heat shock protein 90 kDa beta 1 (Hsp90b1); glucosidase, beta (bile acid) 2 (Gba2); protein interacting with PRKCA 1
(Pick1); golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing (Gopc);
casein kinase 2, alpha prime polypeptide (Csnk2a2); autophagy
related 7 (Atg7); small ArfGAP 2 (Smap2); TATA element modulatory
factor 1; (Tmf1 or ARA160); zona pellucida binding protein (Zpbp or
Zpbp1); vacuolar protein sorting 54 (Vps54); ArfGAP with FG repeats

DPY19L4 for which nothing is known. It has been demonstrated that
down-regulation of Dpy19l1 and Dpy19l3 during neurogenesis of
mouse embryos leads to strong neuron migration anomalies (Watanabe
et al., 2011). DPY19L3 has also been associated with bipolar disorder
(Smith et al., 2009). These results strengthen the possibility of a conserved function of the different DPY19L proteins. Interestingly, apart
from DPY19L2, which presents a predominant expression in the testis,
DPY19L proteins show a relatively ubiquitous pattern of expression
(Carson et al., 2006).
After its identification as the main gene involved in globozoospermia,
study of Dpy19l2 KO mice showed that homozygous animals faithfully
reproduced the human phenotype with a complete male infertility,
100% of acrosomeless round-headed spermatozoa and manchette abnormalities (Table III). Study of this model led to the conclusion that
DPY19L2 is a transmembrane protein located in the inner nuclear membrane (Fig. 3) and that it is necessary to anchor the acrosome to the
nucleus. In the absence of Dpy19l2 the forming acrosome slowly separates from the nucleus before being removed from the sperm with the
cytoplasm (Pierre et al., 2012). In addition to its structural function
during acrosome biogenesis, the C-mannosyltransferase function of
the ancestral protein DPY-19 has raised the hypothesis that DPY19L2
may have a function in glycosylation of sperm proteins (Buettner et al.,

2013). Several potential partner proteins have been proposed to interact
with DPY19L2 during spermiogenesis, in particular the SUN proteins
belonging to the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complexes in association with KASH proteins (Pierre et al., 2012). SUN proteins appeared as the best candidate due to their abundance during
spermiogenesis and their role in nuclear shaping during sperm head formation (Go¨b et al., 2010; Frohnert et al., 2011). This hypothesis has
however not been confirmed and the molecular partners of DPY19L2
remain to be characterized (Yassine et al., 2015b). Comparative testicular transcriptome studies of wild type and globozoospermic Dpy19l2 KO
mice were also realized to attempt to identify Dpy19l2 molecular partners but no conclusive result was obtained (Karaouze`ne et al., 2013).
DPY19L2, low copy repeats and copy number
variations: from evolution to mutations
Copy number variations (CNV) refer to gains by duplication or losses by
deletion of genetic material greater than 1 kb. They can be pathogenic
and cause Mendelian traits or be associated with complex diseases but
can also represent benign polymorphic variants. CNVs and in particular
gene duplications are involved as a predominant mechanism driving gene
and genome evolution (reviewed in Zhang et al., 2009). Such a mechanism was involved in theDPY19L gene family evolution throughout the vertebrate lineage. The DPY19L family genes, encompassing four genes
(DPY19L1, 2, 3 and 4) and six pseudogenes, derived from a common ancestor homologous to the C. elegans dpy-19 gene owing to multiple gene
duplications and pseudogenizations throughout evolution (Carson et al.,
2006). It is estimated that the duplication that generated DPY19L2 arose
between 173 and 360 million years ago prior to mammalian divergence.
Recurrent CNVs arise mostly by homologous recombination
between repetitive DNA sequences. This process is called non-allelic
homologous recombination (NAHR) and is well-known in human
diseases to be responsible for many recurrent genomic syndromes
(Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010). The DPY19L2 locus is conducive to recurrent deletions and duplications by NAHR due to the presence of two
homologous 28-kb low copy repeats (LCRs) located on each side of the
gene (Harbuz et al., 2011; Koscinski et al., 2011). Such a recombination
during the meiosis will result in the production of recombinant gametes
having either a duplication or a deletion of the DPY19L2 locus. Sequencing analysis of the NAHR breakpoints at the DPY19L2 locus demonstrated that the recombination events occurred preferentially in the
vicinity of a 13 nucleotide recognition motif for the PRDM9 protein localized in the center of the 28-kb LCRs (Coutton et al., 2013). PRDM9, a
zinc finger protein that binds to DNA sequences, is a major transregulator of meiotic recombination hotspots facilitating double strand
breaks, a prerequisite for NAHR (Baudat et al., 2010; Myers et al.,
2010; Parvanov et al., 2010). An additional putative recombination
hotspot within the 28-kb LCRs might constitute a second, less frequent
recombination site (Elinati et al., 2012).
The NAHR mechanism favors deletions over duplications because the
inter-chromatid and inter-chromosome NAHRs create a deleted and a
duplicated recombined allele, while intra-chromatid events only generate deletions (Liu et al., 2012). More gametes carrying a deletion are
thus expected to be produced de novo and this was verified for several
NAHR hotspots (Turner et al., 2008) and in particular for the
DPY19L2 locus (Coutton et al., 2013). This is paradoxical regarding the
overrepresentation of the duplicated DPY19L2 allele in the general
population. In fact, the frequency of theDPY19L2 duplication and heterozygous deletion in the general population is estimated to be 1/85 and
1/290, respectively. This can be explained by the loss of deleted alleles
occurring during selection against sterile, homozygous deleted men,
whereas duplications carriers are not subjected to selection. Also, heterozygous deleted men might also suffer a small fitness penalty, expediting
the loss of the deleted allele (Coutton et al., 2013).
Clinical management of globozoospermic
patients and DPY19L2: what’s new?
The relationship between sperm chromosomal abnormalities and sperm
morphology has been widely explored. A link has been clearly established in particular for certain types of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa, such as large-headed multiflagellar spermatozoa, but remains
controversial for many others (Sun et al., 2006). Globozoospermia is
no exception and contradictory results were obtained. Some studies
report an increased frequency in sperm aneuploidy compared with
normal sperm cells while others do not observe any difference (reviewed
inDamet al., 2007a; Perrin et al., 2013). Finally, even observed, the slightly increased aneuploidy rate in round-headed sperm is comparable to
that commonly found in other types of infertility (Perrin et al., 2013)
and therefore does not counter indicate the treatment of patients by
ICSI (Kuentz et al., 2013). Despite this, many studies using ICSI for
patients with globozoospermia reported low fertilization, pregnancy
and live birth rates, overall estimated at 38, 20 and 14%, respectively
(reviewed in Da´vila Garza and Patrizio, 2013). A first well-established explanation for the low efficiency of ICSI when using globozoospermic
sperm is the reduction or absence of the sperm factor, a testis-specific
phospholipase (phospholipase C zeta (PLCz)) involved in the oocyte activation (Yoon et al., 2008; Heytens et al., 2009; Kashir et al., 2010;
Amdani et al., 2013; Escoffier et al., 2015). PLCz localizes to the inner
acrosomal membrane and the nuclear theca in the post-acrosomal
region of human sperm which is in accordance with its vanishing in
Dpy19l2-KO globozoospermic sperm (Escoffier et al., 2015). The
absence of oocyte activation can be overcome by artificial oocyte activation (AOA) using Ca2+ ionophore (Rybouchkin et al., 1997; Tejera et al.,
2008;Kyonoet al., 2009;Taylor et al., 2010). In case of globozoospermia,
AOA combined with ICSI improved the efficiency of fertilization, pregnancy and live birth rates compared with conventional ICSI and this, regardless of the genotype (DPY19L2 related or not) of the patients
(Kuentz et al., 2013). However, the live birth rate per transfer remains
lower in globozoospermic patients than in other infertile patients in
the same age group (Palermo et al., 2009; Kuentz et al., 2013). This
may be due to sperm DNA damage related to defective chromatin condensation and the DNA fragmentation described in globozoospermic
sperm cells (Dam et al., 2007a; Brahem et al., 2011; Perrin et al., 2013;
Yassine et al., 2015a). Abnormal chromatin condensation in globozoospermia could be linked to an altered replacement of histones by protamines (Blanchard et al., 1990; Carrell et al., 1999). Yassine et al.
(2015a) using the dpy19l2 KO mouse models confirmed that the
nuclear invasion by protamines during the last stage of compaction is defective. Moreover, the absence of protamine increases dramatically the
susceptibility to DNA breaks. Altogether, epigenetics defects and
DNA fragmentation in globozoospermic sperm nuclei impair the developmental potential of embryos generated by ICSI using Dpy19l2-
dependent spermatozoa (Yassine et al., 2015a). In summary,
Genetic causes of teratozoospermia 469
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/21/4/455/684509 by guest on 18 February 2025
globozoospermic patients withDPY19L2 gene alterations combine a low
oocyte activation rate and a poor development of embryos generated by
ICSI, thus explaining the consistently disappointingly low pregnancy rate
obtained with these patients.
Mutational status in globozoospermic patients treated with ICSI was
generally unknown or not investigated. Few studies reported successful
fertilization or pregnancies in globozoospermic patients with well documented DPY19L2 or SPATA16 mutations (Dam et al., 2007b; Harbuz
et al., 2011; Kuentz et al., 2013; Karaca et al., 2014). Due to this small
number of cases, no evidence of a difference in pregnancy success rate
regarding the mutational status of globozoospermic patients has currently been demonstrated. Further studies taking into account genetic mutations may influence the therapeutic strategy and facilitate improving the
management of patients diagnosed with globozoospermia. To date, only
the type of globozoospermia is known to have an impact on the therapeutic approach as intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection technique (IMSI) has proven effective only for patients with a
partial globozoospermia (Sermondade et al., 2011; Kuentz et al., 2013).
Multiple morphological
abnormalities of the flagella
Morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella leading to asthenozoospermia have been reported regularly since 1984 (Escalier and
David, 1984). Chemes and colleagues carried out much of the early
work on this phenotype and extensively studied the ultrastructure of
the sperm flagella of affected men (Chemes et al., 1987). They observed
recurrent abnormalities of the fibrous sheath (FS) which defines the principal piece surrounding the axoneme and the outer dense fibers and consists of two longitudinal columns connected by circumferential ribs (Eddy
et al., 2003) (Fig. 4). Escalier had previously identified similar flagellar
defects and had described that abnormalities of the peri-axonemal structures (including FS, outer dense fibers, mitochondrial sheath) were
always associated with axonemal defects (Escalier and David, 1984).
She argued that these peri-axonemal defects might be secondary to
the axonemal defects (Escalier and Serres, 1985). Further ultrastructural
studies among patients with sperm flagella abnormalities showed a wide
range of different peri-axonemal and axonemal defects (Rawe et al.,
2001; Chemes and Rawe, 2003).
Cilia and flagellum: a common origin
Although the sperm flagellum and motile cilia (found in the epithelial cells
of the airways, the Fallopian tubes, the choroid plexus and the brain ventricles) are specialized for a particular function, they share common
structural elements as the central cytoskeletal structure called the
axoneme, which is highly conserved throughout evolution. The
axoneme contains 9 outer microtubules doublets and 2 central singlets
(9+2 structure), several axonemal dyneins, radial spokes, nexin links
and many other components that drive and regulate ciliary or flagellar
motility. All these microtubule-associated proteins are attached along
the axoneme in a regular 96 nm long repeated formation (Inaba, 2003;
Satir and Christensen, 2008). The axonemal dyneins are multicomponent proteins organized along each microtubule doublet as
inner and outer rows (Fig. 4B and C) and comprise motor multiprotein
complexes which produce the cilia/flagella beating force (Wickstead
and Gull, 2007). Dynein arms are composed of heavy chains (HC),
intermediate chains (IC), light-intermediate chains (LIC) and light
chains (LC) and numerous regulatory proteins (Bisgrove and Yost,
2006). The structure of the inner dynein arms is more complex than
the structure of the outer dynein arms, which, in mammals, contains
only two different HCs repeated all along the axoneme. In mammals,
the inner arms are organized in seven molecular complexes, viewed in
electronic microscopy as globular heads arranged in 3-2-2 groups, thus
corresponding to 3 types of inner dynein arms (IDA): IDA1 to IDA3
(Vernon et al., 2005). The mammalian organization was however
much less investigated than in Chlamydomonas (Bui et al., 2008), and
the subunit composition of each inner arm remains to be determined. Although sperm flagella and motile cilia have a similar microtubule structure
based on the presence of a 9+2 axoneme, they present several differences. Motile cilia are constituted almost exclusively by the axoneme,
whereas mammalian sperm flagella are divided into three principal
parts characterized by the presence of additional accessory structures
surrounding the axoneme: the outer dense fiber, the mitochondrial
sheath, the fibrous sheath (Fig. 4). Recent proteomic analysis identified
over 700 proteins that are exclusively localized in the human sperm flagella, of which many are axonemal proteins (Baker et al., 2013). These
data highlight the complexity of the flagella structure and biogenesis, suggesting that many genes could be linked to flagellar abnormalities and/or
asthenozoospermia.
Primary ciliary dyskinesia
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a multisystemic disorder caused by
motility defects of motile cilia and flagella (Afzelius and Eliasson, 1983;
Munroet al., 1994). PCD is mainly characterized by recurrent respiratory
tract infections with varying symptoms ranging from chronic rhinosinusitis to bronchiectasis and male infertility due to sperm immotility (Iban˜ezTallon et al., 2003). Female subfertility is less common and is caused by
dysmotile Fallopian tubes cilia (Lyons et al., 2006). PCD is also associated
in 50% of cases with situs invertus due to dysfunction of motile embryonic
node cilia perturbing organ laterality (Zariwala et al., 1993). More rarely,
hydrocephalus arises as a consequence of ependymal cilia dysmotility
leading to a blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid flow (Iban˜ez-Tallon
et al., 2002; Kosaki et al., 2004). PCD has an estimated incidence of 1
per 15 000 births (Knowles et al., 2013a) but it may be underestimated
due to diagnostic failure (Boon et al., 2013).
A high prevalence of PCD was observed in different genetic isolates
and consanguineous populations, a fact consistent with a mainly
autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (Jeganathan et al., 2004;
O’Callaghan et al., 2010). PCD is genetically heterogeneous (Horani
et al., 2014) and research on PCD allowed the characterization of numerous proteins necessary for adequate axonemal molecular structure and
assembly. Cilia and flagella are remarkably well conserved throughout
evolution. Different experimental models were used to decipher the molecular composition and function of these organelles (Ostrowski et al.,
2011). The first model was the green alga Chlamydomonas in which
DNAI1, the first gene to be associated with PCD, was identified (Pennarun et al., 1999). The function of the genes involved in PCD was also
efficiently assessed in other multicellular organisms, such as zebrafish,
Xenopus, Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila, and protists, such as Paramecium, Tetrahymena, Trypanosoma or Leishmania, each bringing specific
advantages to the study of cilium biology (review in Vincensini et al.,
2011). Thereafter, various studies using a candidate gene approach

mainly based on data from Chlamydomonas have resulted in the identification of many mutated genes in PCD patients. Different KO mice or
inbred dogs deficient in various axonemal components have also been
successfully described as mammalian models for PCD (review in Inaba,
2011). Mutations in 28 genes leading to various ultrastructural defects
have so far been described to cause PCD (Table VI) and account for
the genetic etiology of 70% of affected individuals (Knowles et al.,
2014). A male infertility phenotype has often been described as part of
the clinical symptoms but this particular aspect of the physiopathology
of the PCD is not systematically explored and is often only scarcely
described in scientific reports (Table VI). The sperm of infertile male
patients with PCD are usually immotile and present various ultrastructural defects of sperm flagella such as missing dynein arms, microtubular
translocations, and lack of radial spokes. Nevertheless, in most cases the
sperm flagellum appears morphologically normal under direct light microscopy (Table VI) thereby excluding most of these genes as a genetic
cause of teratozoospermia or MMAF.
Genetic investigations of MMAF
A genetic origin of MMAF was strongly suspected based on a family clustering reported in at least 20% of patients (Chemes and Alvarez Sedo,
2012). In 2005, Bacetti et al. (Baccetti et al., 2005a) first reported a
partial deletion in the A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 3 (AKAP3) and
A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) genes in a patient presenting
with short-tail spermatozoa. Ultrastructural sperm evaluation showed
MMAF and an altered axonemal structure lacking dynein arms and microtubular doublets including the central pair. A kinase (PRKA) anchor
protein 3 (AKAP3) and A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 3 (AKAP4)
encode two A-kinase anchoring proteins interacting with the regulatory
subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. AKAP3 and AKAP4 are
the most abundant structural proteins of the fibrous sheath. AKAP3 is
involved in organizing the basic structure of the fibrous sheath while
AKAP4 has a major role in completing fibrous sheath assembly (Brown
et al., 2003). Akap4 KO mice are infertile with half-length flagella with a

thinner principal piece and a tip sometimes curled or splayed into fine filaments. The size and integrity of mutant mitochondrial sheaths are also
reduced. However, other cytoskeletal structures, namely the outer
dense fibers and the axoneme, remain intact (Miki et al., 2002). Mouse
models thus present strong evidence that Akap3 and 4 are involved in
MMAF phenotype. Evidence of their implication in the human phenotype
is however weaker. A deletion of AKAP3 and AKAP4 was described in a
MMAF patient but it was only detected using conventional PCR and
the genomic breakpoints were not identified (Baccetti et al., 2005a).
Moreover, no quantitative analyses of DNA or mRNA were used to
confirm the observed deletions and exclude a false negative PCR
result. The authors then demonstrated an absence of staining in patient’s
spermatozoa using immunofluorescence with AKAP4 antibodies (Baccetti et al., 2005a). The absence of the AKAP4 protein in mature
sperm may however be secondary to another defect disorganizing the
whole sperm flagella structure (Baccetti et al., 2004). Additionally,
Turner et al. (2001) did not find any mutation in these two genes in 9
MMAF patients.
More recently homozygous mutations in the DNAH1 gene were identified in several patients with MMAF (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014). DNAH1
encodes an axonemal inner arm dynein HC and is expressed in various
tissues including the testis (Maiti et al., 2000). Homozygosity mapping
was carried out on a cohort of 20 North African individuals. Four different homozygous mutations in DNAH1, one run-on, one missense and
two splice site mutations were identified in seven patients including
three brothers. Electron microscopy examination of spermatozoa
revealed a general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization
of the microtubule doublets, absence of the central pair in about half
of the analyzed cross sections, loss of the inner arm dynein as well as
severe disorganization of the fibrous sheath, the outer dense fibers
and the mitochondrial sheath (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014). All these
defects are hallmarks of the MMAF phenotype. Molecular and functional
studies on samples from one of the mutated patients carrying the recurrent splicing mutation (c.11788-1G.A) demonstrated that the transcript and the protein were absent, confirming that the observed
phenotype is due to the complete absence of DNAH1. This initial
study thus indicates that 70% of DFS patients are expected to bear a
genetic alteration in other genes, thus confirming that, like PCD,
MMAF is genetically heterogeneous and that many other genes are
likely involved in this syndrome. Lastly, the patient with the less severe
missense variant presented a milder phenotype with 5% motility and
the presence of 6% morphologically normal spermatozoa in contrast
to the other DNAH1-mutated patients which had 100% abnormal
sperm and 0% motility (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014). It could therefore be
expected that individuals with intermediate asthenozoospermia and a
low level of morphological anomalies could also harbor homozygous
or compound heterozygous DNAH1 mutations of moderate severity.
The phenotype observed in DNAH1-mutated patients extends
beyond the absence of flagellar motility, as usually observed in other axonemal component defects, and substantiates a role for this protein in the
maintenance of the structural integrity of the flagella. In Dnahc1 KO mice
(the mouse ortholog of DNAH1, previously called Mdhc7), ‘rapid-freeze
deep-etch electron microscopy’ studies indicated that one head of the
IDA3 was missing, leading to a 3-2-1 globular head arrangement and suggesting that DNAH1 is one of the components of the IDA3 (Vernon et al.,
2005). In Tetrahymena thermophila, IDA3 corresponds to the dynein d/a
which is directly connected to the radial spoke RS3 through an arc-like
structure (King, 2013). In mammals, the three radial spokes (RS1, RS2,
and RS3) are multiprotein complexes allowing a connection between
the external microtubule doublets and the two central microtubules
thus stabilizing the axoneme (Pigino et al., 2011). Therefore, the
severe axonemal disorganization observed in DNAH1-mutated patients
may occur as a result of the abrogation of RS3 anchoring, leading to the
absence of the central pair and the mislocalization of the peripheral doublets (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014). KO male mice lacking Dnah1 are infertile
but only present with asthenozoospermia, without the sperm morphological abnormalities observed in human. Aside from the fact that there
might be some divergences in flagellar biogenesis between mouse and
human, an incomplete disruption of the targeted dynein was reported
in the mouse model, which may explain this phenotypic difference
(Neesen et al., 2001; Ben Khelifa et al., 2014).
The central pair microtubules: the central key
of MMAF phenotype?
The central pair microtubules (CP) are composed of two microtubule
singlets, named C1 and C2, which are structurally and biochemically distinct. Structural studies in Chlamydomonasshowed that the C1 tubule has
two long projections (1a and 1b) and two short projections (1c and 1d).
The C2 tubule has three short projections termed 2a, 2b and 2c. The CP
contains at least 23 distinct proteins and some of these proteins are
uniquely associated with either C1 or C2, indicating that the two microtubules may be functionally specialized. Evidence supports the fact that
the CP projections interact with the RS heads and modulate dynein activity (reviewed in Wargo and Smith, 2003).
It is worth noting that the lack of the CPs leading to an abnormal ‘9+0’
configuration of the axoneme is the main defect observed in most cases
associated with MMAF (Chemes and Rawe, 2003). Such a defect was also
observed in patients with DNAH1 mutations (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014).
These observations raise the hypothesis that CP disorganization might
be the cornerstone leading to the MMAF phenotype. Several experimental models support the idea that some structural defects impacting theCP
give rise to MMAF (Fig. 4C and Table VII). Axonemal abnormalities have
been observed in spermatids from testicular biopsies underlining that the
onset of the defect occurs during the late stages of spermiogenesis due to
a defective assembly of cytoskeletal components of the sperm tail
(Chemes and Rawe, 2010). Interestingly, in some cases, the disorganization of the microtubules has been described to increase and the sperm
phenotype to worsen during the sperm transit through the epididymal
duct (Sapiro et al., 2002; Sironen et al., 2011). This suggests that CP
defects precede other more severe structural abnormalities by weakening all the axonemal organization making the flagella vulnerable to mechanical stress during spermiogenesis and sperm transit. This demonstrates
that CP plays a major role in maintaining the global flagellum organization
throughout spermiogenesis. This could explain why most other axonemal defects, not affecting the CP structure, do not lead to the
MMAF phenotype.
As a consequence, all genes encoding a protein interacting directly (CP
components) or indirectly with the CP apparatus, like RS, some dynein
arms or different partner proteins, are henceforth good candidates for
the MMAF phenotype (Fig. 4C). As an example, depletion of mouse
Meig1, a protein that interacts directly with Spag16 (Table VII) leads to
shorter flagella, absence of the normal ‘9+2’ axoneme arrangement
and peri-axonemal disorganization (Zhang et al., 2004; Salzberg et al.,
474 Coutton et al.

2010; Teves et al., 2013). In humans, several studies reported mutations
in the coiled-coil domain containing 39 (CCDC39), coiled-coil domain
containing 40 (CCDC40), radial spoke head 1 homolog (RSPH1), radial
spoke head 4 homolog A (RSPH4A), radial spoke head 9 homolog
RSPH9 and HYDIN, axonemal central pair apparatus protein (HYDIN)
genes leading to CP defects. However, few phenotypic descriptions or
structural studies have been carried out on sperm samples from
mutated patients (Table VI). Only Merveille et al. (2011) reported that
the sperm flagellum was shortened in patients with a mutation in the
CCDC39 gene, a feature consistent with the MMAF phenotype and our
hypothesis.
PCD to MMAF phenotype: a phenotypic
continuum?
DNAH1 is the first inner arm dynein gene involved in a human pathology
and the first axonemal gene responsible for a male infertility phenotype
without any of the other symptoms usually observed in PCD. These
novel mutations in the axonemal dyneinDNAH1 strengthen the emerging
point of view that MMAF may be a phenotypic variation of the classical
forms of PCD with a continuum of clinical manifestations ranging from infertile PCD patients to MMAF patients with no or low noise PCD manifestations. Indeed, many genes are likely to have a specific function in the
sperm flagellum with potentially several paralogs that could carry out a
similar function in other ciliated tissues, thus explaining the absence of
a more severe PCD phenotype. For instance, absence of respiratory
symptoms in DNAH1-mutated patients may be explained by other
dyneins phylogenetically close to DNAH1 which may compensate the
absence ofDNAH1 in other motile cilia (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014). This hypothesis has also been mentioned in a reverse situation where PCD
patients with mutations in the CCDC114, a gene encoding an outer
dynein arm docking complex, had no fertility problems. The authors proposed that CCDC114 function could be partially replaced by CCDC63,
a homologous protein of CCDC114 with an expression restricted to the
testis (Onoufriadis et al., 2013). Unfortunately, no nasal brushings or biopsies from DNAH1-mutated individuals could be obtained to search for
infra-clinical manifestations by exploring the patient’s ciliary function in
respiratory epithelium. In addition, alternative splicing is widespread in
mammals and splice variants often exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns (Yu et al., 2014). Therefore some mutations may affect alternative
variants specifically expressed in testis while having no effect in other
tissues.
Overall, these observations support the fact that important differences exist between the axonemal assembly/function of respiratory
cilia and sperm flagella that explain why PCDs are not always associated
with primary flagellar defects and vice versa. This was supported by
mutations in DNAH5, an outer dynein arm, which are associated with
the absence of outer dynein arms in respiratory cilia while a normal distribution of ODA heavy chain was reported in the sperm flagellum of
mutated patients (Fliegauf et al., 2005). Mutations in DNAH11, another
outer dynein arm, although associated with a normal axonemal ultrastructure, led to a PCD phenotype also with normal male fertility (Bartoloni et al., 2002; Schwabe et al., 2008). In many mouse models with a
MMAF-like phenotype, the structural disorder appears to be specific
to sperm tail development, because no effects on the architecture of
cilia in the respiratory or female reproductive tract have been observed
(Pilder et al., 1997; Fossella et al., 2000; Campbell et al., 2002; Miki et al.,
2002; Sapiro et al., 2002; Sironen et al., 2006, 2011; Zhang et al., 2006;
Lessard et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Salzberg et al., 2010; Nakamura
et al., 2013). Despite this normal axonemal organization, respiratory
symptoms or lower tracheal ciliary beat frequency and/or hydrocephalus were described (Sapiro et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2008; Sironen et al.,
2011). These findings highlight the duality of function of various proteins,
involved in sperm flagellum biogenesis and in the motility of tracheal and
ependymal cilia. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying differences between cilia and flagella and to decipher the specific proteome of these two closely related organelles.
Clinical implications of flagellar defects: return
to base
In dividing cells, the centrioles form the core of the centrosome which is
the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells and it is
involved in numerous functions such as the organization of the
mitotic/meiotic spindle (reviewed in Bettencourt-Dias and Glover,
2007). During flagellum biogenesis, the sperm centrioles migrate to
the spermatid periphery and form the basal bodies from which the flagellar axoneme originates (Chemes, 2012). Centrioles are embedded in a
matrix of proteins known as the pericentriolar material that supports
motor proteins such as dyneins or kinesins (Schatten and Sun, 2009).
Moreover, during fertilization in human, the sperm centrosome organizes the sperm aster which is essential to unite the sperm and the
oocyte pronuclei (Sathananthan et al., 1991). The sperm centrosome
also controls the syngamy and the first mitotic divisions after fertilization
(Schatten and Sun, 2009).
Primary flagellar abnormalities have been associated with an elevated
frequency of gonosomal disomies and diploidies (Lewis-Jones et al.,
2003; Baccetti et al., 2005b; Rives et al., 2005; Collodel and Moretti,
2006; Ghedir et al., 2014). In the light of the above, chromosomal abnormalities observed in MMAF patients may be linked to the common components shared between the sperm centrosome and the flagella.
Therefore, it could be speculated that defects in some of these
centrosome-associated proteins may disturb both flagellum formation
and spindle assembly during sperm meiosis, resulting in nondisjunction
errors and spermatozoa aneuploidy (Rives et al., 2005). No chromosomal abnormalities were however detected in one patient with short-tailed
spermatozoa (Viville et al., 2000) pointing out that all flagellar defects do
not impact the centrosomal function.
Sperm aneuploidy could impede ICSI outcomes in patients with flagellar defects. Nevertheless several studies described the successful application of ICSI to treat male infertility due to MMAF or PCD (for review
Chemes and Rawe, 2003,Chemes and Alvarez Sedo, 2012;Da´vila Garza
and Patrizio, 2013). The most recent review estimated the mean overall
fertilization, pregnancy and live birth rates in MMAF patients at 63, 57 and
43%, respectively (Da´vila Garza and Patrizio, 2013). In PCD patients, this
review found fertilization and pregnancy rates ranging from 55 to 65%
and from 35 to 45%, respectively, depending with the sperm source (ejaculated or testicular). The overall live birth rate was estimated at 39%.
Interestingly although the results compare favorably with the overall
results obtained after ICSI, the rate of ICSI success seems to be influenced by the type of ultrastructural flagellar defects carried by the
patients (Mitchell et al., 2006; Fauque et al., 2009). Mitchell et al.
(2006) reported a lower implantation and clinical pregnancy rate in
patients without axonemal central structures (i.e. ‘9+0’ axoneme).

Likewise, Fauque et al. (2009)reported a slower kinetics of early embryo
cleavage and a lower implantation rate when a central pair of singlet
microtubules was missing. These data question the possibility of a link
between some specific axonemal structural defects and abnormal embryonic development in human. Since axonemal structures and sperm
asters come from the sperm centrosome, it is possible that some of
the described cases of fertilization failure and abnormal embryonic development reported in MMAF patients might be caused by defects in centrosomal or pericentrosomal proteins (Sathananthan, 1994; Van
Blerkom, 1996; Chemes, 2012). The use of heterologous ICSI systems
(human-bovine, human-rabbit) with sperm from infertile men with
MMAF supported this hypothesis, showing a lower rate of sperm aster
formation (Rawe et al., 2002; Terada et al., 2004). Interestingly, IVF
experiments in Dnah1 KO mice demonstrated a retarded rate of early
embryo development (Neesen et al., 2001). Unfortunately, in patients
with DNAH1 mutations no data relative to ICSI attempts were available
(Ben Khelifa et al., 2014). Lastly, although there has been no report of an
abnormal birth from patients with MMAF or PCD, the risk of genetic
defects other than infertility linked to the sperm structural defects
should be discussed during genetic counseling (Sha et al., 2014). We
believe that genetics data combined with careful analysis using electron
microscopy will, in time, permit us to optimize the course of treatment
for MMAF patients.
Translation of the genetic
information to the clinic: the way
forward
ART can circumvent infertility, and IVF with ISCI is possible for most
patients regardless of the etiology of the defects. Unfortunately the availability of these technologies does not guarantee success and almost half
the couples who seek reproductive assistance fail to achieve a pregnancy.
The improvement of ART procedures is therefore particularly relevant
and this strongly relies on a better understanding of spermatogenesis
and of the molecular physiopathology of infertility. This mission involves
the identification of genes responsible for male infertility. To date, a very
short list of genes was identified which is in sharp contrast with the fact
that several hundreds of genes (probably well in excess of a thousand)
are estimated to be involved in spermatogenesis and male reproduction.
Although genetic causes of human male fertility remain largely unknown,
genetics investigations of some specific teratozoospermic phenotypes
have yielded fruitful results. The key to success in the identification of infertility genes was largely based on the study of clinically and genetically
homogenous phenotypes in small cohorts with consanguineous subjects
and large families. This led in particular to the identification of AURKC and
DPY19L2 and to the development of diagnoses for both genes, which are
now recommended for patients presenting macrozoospermia and globozoospermia, respectively. Additional efforts are needed to identify
genes in others syndromes and more generally in all phenotypes of
male infertility in which many genes remain to be identified in human.
The recent identification of DNAH1 in patients with MMAF is promising
although a positive diagnosis is achieved for only 28% of the patients.
This indicates that MMAF is genetically heterogeneous and that many
other genes are likely involved in this syndrome.
Homozygosity mapping has so far permitted the identification of the
three main genes discussed in this review. This strategy can only be
successful when studying large families or consanguineous patients presenting with a very homogeneous phenotypes. Due to the great genetic
heterogeneity of infertility, this technique has now reached its limits and
microarray analyses are now replaced by the fast evolving technology of
next generation sequencing. Sequencing of all the coding sequences, or
exome sequencing, can now be realized in a few weeks at a cost of
400 –1000 E. Whole exome sequencing will be available on the next
day (in a few years time) for probably less than that cost. This technical
revolution is what was needed to unlock the secrets of male infertility.
Exomic/genomic sequencing of large cohorts of patients is now necessary to identify the thousands of mutations involved in infertility and
the hundreds of genes necessary to achieve efficient spermatogenesis.
The identification of variants in candidate genes will be fast, but long
and complex analyses will be necessary to confirm the pathogenic
effect of the identified variants and more so to understand the function
of the identified proteins. We can be confident that the number of
genes and mutations identified in the pathological context of infertility
will increase exponentially over the next few years.
The next step will be to exploit these data to the benefit of the patients.
Genotype/phenotype correlation will allow us to provide the best advice
and care to patients and to answer many questions: is the risk of aneuploidy increased and is it therefore advisable to do ICSI? Or do we recommend performing PGD? Can we expect to find some sperm in this
patient’s testis and is it worth doing a biopsy? Such prognoses are
already available for a handful of patients: ICSI is contraindicated to
patients with a homozygous AURKC mutation and a testicular biopsy
should not be attempted for men with an AZFa or b deletion (Krausz
et al., 2014). The discovery of DPY19L2 provided a better insight of
the molecular pathogeny of globozoospermia. A recent work showed
that testicular sperm present similar DNA defects to epididymal
sperm thus suggesting that testicular biopsy is not relevant in this case
(Yassine et al., 2015a). Moreover, the demonstration that the sperm
factor (PLCzeta) is absent in globozoospermic sperm might justify the
use of AOA in this pathology (Escoffier et al., 2015). With an increased
list of genes associated with infertility we can expect that a better prognosis and improved advice and treatments will soon be available to many
more patients.
We are also convinced that another revolution is brewing.We are currently measuring the limitation of the whole IVF and ICSI strategy that is
proposed to most infertile patients, especially those bearing the most
severe defects. Alternative treatment strategies will only be possible
with an in-depth comprehension of all aspects of spermatogenesis and
of the physiopathology of sperm defects. The basis of this comprehension stems from the identification of the genes involved and of their
function.We believe that male infertility might be among the pathologies
that are best suited for targeted protein therapy and we are convinced
that restoration of a functional spermatogenesis will be possible by
reintroducing a deficient or missing protein as: (i) treatment success
can be measured easily and objectively by a mere spermogram, (ii) in
man spermatogenesis lasts 70 days. This corresponds to the necessary
treatment duration to obtain functional gametes, which can then be cryopreserved and used at a later date to initiate any number of pregnancies.
This relatively short treatment is in sharp contrast with life-long supplementations needed for most other genetic diseases.We thus believe the
identification of the genetic causes of infertility will permit us to develop
therapies tailored to restore specifically the identified defects. Different
options are possible, ranging from direct protein or mRNA injection into
Genetic causes of teratozoospermia 477

the rete testis (Ogawa et al., 1997) to injection of expression vectors via
lipid shuttles or a virus vector such as adeno-associated viruses (AAV). As
the targeted cells produce the gametes that will be used to achieve a
pregnancy it is crucial that no genetic material is inserted into the
genome, to preclude the transmission of potential deleterious effects
to the next generations. At the moment even AAV vectors, which are
considered as non-integrating and have been used successfully on post
mitotic tissues in many clinical trials, have been found integrating the
genome of the target cells at a frequency of 1024
– 1025 (Kaufmann
et al., 2013). For the time being, this low level of insertion precludes
the utilization of viral vectors in the context of infertility, but we can
hope that fully non-integrative vector will soon be available. Protein
therapy is also possible ex vivo in testis culture systems but it is labor intensive and therefore less amenable to transposition to many different
specific genetic defects. KO mice that have so far been used to study
the physiopathology of abnormal spermatogenesis should now be
used to evaluate the feasibility of different treatment options. The efficient delivery of the replacement protein will be subordinate to the
nature and the localization of the defective native protein and the
mode of delivery will have to be adjusted to ensure specificity. We
however firmly believe that the restricted localization of the targeted
cells (in the testis) and the limited duration of treatment clearly favor
the development of innovative therapies applied to male infertility.
In conclusion, now is a very exciting time in the field of the genetics of
infertility. We have so far seen only a small part of the tip of the iceberg
but we are confident that the rest will come to light in the foreseeable
future. We believe that this work will be the cornerstone of the next
revolution in ART allowing the clinician not just to bypass the abnormalities by forceful ICSI but to propose new therapeutic strategies allowing
the selective repair of the broken parts.
